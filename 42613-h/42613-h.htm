<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>The first digital electronic device employed to collect nuclear
data was the binary electronic counter (scaler) of the
1930's. In the next decade single and multichannel pulse-height
analyzers appeared, still using vacuum tubes. In the
1950's the development of multichannel analyzers continued
vigorously, with vast improvement of the analog-to-digital
converter sections and with the introduction of computer-type
memories, based first on acoustic delay lines and a short
time later on ferrite cores. The replacement of vacuum tubes
by transistors beginning in the latter half of the 1950's
accelerated the pace of development and application of all
types of electronic laboratory instruments.</p>

<p>The 1960's was the decade of the computer. Before the
1960's almost no on-line computers were used in nuclear research,
but since about 1962 the computer has moved into the
nuclear laboratory. It provides the research worker with an
immensely flexible, powerful, and accurate tool capable of
raising the research output of a laboratory while eliminating
the most tedious part of the experimental work.</p>

<p>The phenomenal speed of development of computer hardware,
software, and methodology contributes to the difficulty experienced
by everybody involved in decision-making processes
regarding data-acquisition systems. Since the cost of a
computer system is often a sizable fraction of the total cost
of a new laboratory, there is urgent need for a set of guiding
rules or principles for use by a laboratory director planning
a system, a reviewer going over a proposal for support, or a
potential funding agency considering proposals and reviews.
The purpose of this report is to assist in filling this need.
The material presented is current through 1969. Although we
deal with a field that is developing rapidly, we hope that a
substantial portion of the material covered will have long-lasting
value.</p>

<p>The report was prepared by the Ad Hoc Panel on On-Line
Computers in Nuclear Research of the Committee on Nuclear
Science, National Research Council. Appointed in March 1968,
the Panel first met in Washington, D.C., on April 22, 1968.</p>

<p>The original members of the Panel were H. W. Fulbright,
H. L. Gelernter, L. J. Lidofsky, D. Ophir (through late 1968),
L. B. Robinson, and M. W. Sachs. In June 1968, this group
prepared an interim report. L. J. Lidofsky was on sabbatical
leave in Europe and therefore could not participate during
the academic year 1968-1969. Early in 1969 J. F. Mollenauer
and J. Hahn joined the Panel.</p>

<p>The Panel has reviewed the present state of the field
and has attempted to anticipate future needs. We have agreed
on many important matters, including especially useful design
features for computers employed in data acquisition, as well
as types of organization of data-acquisition systems suitable
for various purposes, types of software that manufacturers
should supply, and approximate costs of systems, and we present
a number of recommendations in these areas. However, the Panel
makes no recommendation on standards for computer hardware,
such as logic levels and polarities, because of a conviction
that these are now rapidly being established as a result of
sound engineering progress and the pressure of economic competition
in the fast-moving computer business.</p>

<p>Throughout this report we have expressed opinions based
on our own experience and on the best information at our
disposal. The nature of the report seemed to demand some
discussion of properties of specific computers by name. We
have tried to be neither misleading nor unjust in our evaluations.</p>

<p>We wish to thank everyone who has aided us, especially
P. W. McDaniel, C. V. Smith, and G. Rogosa of the U.S. Atomic
Energy Commission and the many scientists in AEC-and NSF-sponsored
laboratories who supplied the basic data on which
the economic survey chapter is based. We are indebted to
several members of the staff of the Department of Physics
and Astronomy of the University of Rochester for assistance
in the preparation of the manuscript, especially Mrs. Brignall
and Mrs. Hughes. We also received initial directions and
many helpful suggestions from D. A. Bromley, Chairman of the
Committee on Nuclear Science, F. S. Goulding, Chairman of the
Subcommittee on Instrumentation and Methods, W. S. Rodney and
P. Donovan of the National Science Foundation, and Charles
K. Reed, Executive Secretary of the Committee on Nuclear
Science.</p>

THE TASKS AND THE COMPUTERS</h2>

<h3>A. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>On-line data-acquisition computer systems are made in a wide
range of types and sizes. In all cases at least one electronic
computer is involved&mdash;a stored-program machine&mdash;because
wired-program devices such as pulse-height analyzers are not
considered to be computers. The rest of the system typically
consists of input/output (I/O) devices such as analog-to-digital
converters (ADC's), printers, cathode-ray oscilloscopes,
plotters, and control devices, which may include, in addition
to the console typewriter, switch boxes to simplify the control
of special types of operations and perhaps a set of logic
circuits associated with the input system, used to provide
preliminary selection of incoming data. In a small but increasing
number of cases a computer is seen dedicated entirely
to a "process-control" application such as the automatic
adjustment of the shim coils of a variable-energy
cyclotron or the control of data acquisition in a nuclear-scattering
experiment, adjustments such as changing the angle
of observation being made essentially under direct automatic
control of the computer. The smallest on-line systems use
the smallest commercially available computers; the largest
use computers bigger than those which until recently served
most computing centers. Large systems sometimes include one
or more satellite computers. The cost of individual systems
ranges from $25,000 to $1,000,000, approximately. The total
cost of computer systems in low-energy nuclear laboratories
is estimated by now to have reached about $20,000,000.
(There has been a larger expenditure in the high-energy nuclear
field, where computer systems have been employed extensively
for some years longer and where experiments are so
expensive that the economic advantages of computer use were
quickly recognized.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<h3>B. THE TASKS</h3>
<p>We first list the main uses to which on-line computer systems
have been put. We start with the simple operations, which we
call Class 1.</p>

<p class="topg"><i>Class 1 operations</i>:</p>

<p>a. Accepting digital data from external devices and
storing it in computer memory.</p>

<p>b. Preliminary processing of incoming data, on-line,
before storage. This usually involves only operations of
logic and simple arithmetic.</p>

<p>c. Controlling the presentation of data via cathode-ray
oscilloscope or typewriter, often for the purpose of monitoring
the progress of an experiment.</p>

<p>d. Controlling the recording of digital data on magnetic
tape, paper tape, or other storage medium.</p>

<p>e. Controlling an incremental plotter.</p>

<p>f. Controlling the output of large quantities of data
via a line printer.</p>

<p>g. Transmission of quantities of data between two computers
or between a computer and a pulse-height analyzer or
other device having a magnetic core memory.</p>

<p class="topg">Several operations of intermediate complexity we will
label Class 2.</p>

<p class="topg"><i>Class 2 operations</i>:</p>
<p>a. Processing of data already accumulated and stored
either in memory or on tape or other medium (off-line processing).
This data reduction is often more complicated and
lengthy than the preliminary on-line processing referred to
in (Class 1b).</p>

<p>b. Calculation of information required by the experimenter
during the experiment, for example, kinematics tables
and particle energies corresponding to field strengths in
analyzer magnets.</p>

<p>c. Process-control operations, in which the computer
directs or regulates a sequence of events in an experiment.
Under program control the computer monitors the course of
the experiment and supplies signals that cause automatic
changes in experimental conditions, such as starting and
stopping times of event counting, angles of observation of
scattered particles, and accelerator energies. Such applications
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
are designed to relieve the experimenter of unnecessary
labor and to reduce the probability of error in routine
operations.</p>

<p class="topg">Our final class involves even more complex calculations.</p>
<p class="topg"><i>Class 3 operations</i>:</p>
<p>a. Complicated treatment of reduced data, including
least squares and curve fitting.</p>

<p>b. Large-scale calculations such as those required for
the evaluation of theoretical nuclear scattering and reaction
cross sections, e.g., DWBA calculations, which may each require
running times of the order of minutes, even at a modern
computing center.</p>

<p class="topg">Apparently Class 3 operations do not always have to be done
during the course of the experiment; in fact, they can in
most cases be carried out later, leisurely, at the local computing
center. Nonetheless, calculations of the first type,
and to a lesser extent the second, are currently being done
at laboratories having large, powerful computers in their
on-line data-acquisition systems.</p>

<h3>C. THE COMPUTERS</h3>
<h4>1. Introduction</h4>
<p>Because computers have proved useful in so many fields, many
varieties are now on the market, quite a few of them having
properties highly suitable for nuclear-data acquisition. The
properties particularly useful are, first, the ease with which
a great variety of external input and output devices can be
attached (interfaced to the computer); second, provisions for
rapid, efficient response to interrupt signals from external
devices; and third, usually a means of transferring data from
external devices directly into blocks of memory without use
of the central processor, the transfer possibly requiring only
a single memory cycle per word. (This is referred to as
direct memory access through a direct data channel.)</p>

<p>Several types of small computers have appeared on the
market during the past year, some having 8-bit words, but they
are too small for general data-acquisition use, although valuables
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
for special applications. For present purposes, the
smallest useful machines have a minimum memory size of 4096
(4k) 12-bit words, which can usually be enlarged to 32k words
by the addition of memory modules, while the larger machines
have minimum memories of at least 8k, with provision for expansion
to several hundred k. Regardless of their size, the
machines of the present generation all have memory cycle
times around 1 or 2 µsec.</p>


<h4>2. Rough Classification of Computers</h4>
<p>Before proceeding with the discussion it is convenient to
find a simple scheme for classifying computers. The scheme
adopted here is to divide them into three loosely defined
classes&mdash;small, medium, and large&mdash;essentially on the basis
of the properties of the basic central processors:</p>

<p>
Small<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Word length 12 to 18 bits</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Useful memory size 4k</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Number of bits in instruction 3 or 4</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Floating-point hardware orally offered</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Approximate cost range $8500 to $40,000</span><br />
</p>

<p>
Medium<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Word length 16 to 24 bits</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Useful memory size 8 to 16k</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Number of bits in instruction 4 to 6</span><br />

<p>Computers do not fall neatly into these three classifications,
especially since manufacturers offer many optional features;
therefore, some argument about the assignment of a particular
machine to one or the other class is possible. This is especially
true with respect to the small and medium types.
The properties of a large number of small and medium-sized
computers are given in Appendix A. Information on larger
machines can be found in the Adams Associates <i>Computer
Characteristics Quarterly</i>.</p>

<h3>D. MATCHING COMPUTERS TO TASKS</h3>

<p>Having classified both the computers and the jobs that they
may be called on to do, we now ask this question: How suitable
is each of the three types of computers for each of the
three classes of jobs, given that in every case the acquisition
system consists of a single computer coupled to all
necessary input and output equipment?</p>

<h4>1. Large Computers</h4>
<p>We start with the large computer system. All classes of
jobs can be handled by this powerful system. However, we
should question the wisdom of assembling a system based on
a large machine unless a substantial amount of numerical
calculating is anticipated, because the essential advantage
of the large computer&mdash;the advantage that costs so much&mdash;is
its capacity for rapidly executing highly accurate floating-point
arithmetical operations.</p>

<h4>2. Small Computers</h4>
<p>The small computer system can handle the jobs of data acceptance,
data manipulation, and output characteristic of the
simple Class 1 operations, but they are suitable for very
few jobs involving floating-point arithmetic. In fact, we
must usually be skeptical about the use of small machines
for any of the Class 2 operations except those of the process-control
type, which in many cases would involve little if any
arithmetic. (Process-control applications have been rather
few to date, but a rapid increase can be expected in this
field, especially because of the convenience and low cost of
small modern computers.) It is apparent that these machines
have been designed as economical instruments specifically
intended to handle Class 1 jobs. The smallest word length
of a machine in this group, 12 bits, is sufficient for
storing in one word the output of a 4096-channel ADC unit,
but it is not quite so convenient for handling the output of
a typical scaler, which would likely require the use of two
words. The capability of even a small computer system to
convert experimental information into digital form, to transfer
it into memory, to manipulate it, and to present it for
inspection in a digested, convenient form, all at a high rate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and essentially without error, is of immense value to an experimenter
who has to cope with the abundant outflow of data
from a modern nuclear experiment.</p>

<h4>3. Medium-Sized Computers</h4>
<p>The capabilities of medium-sized computers are less clear.
These machines are superior to the small ones mainly in two
respects: they have a more flexible command structure (i.e.,
they have a larger set of wired-in operations), and, usually,
they have a longer word length. These features make them
easier to program and give them a limited, but important,
capability to execute floating-point operations sufficiently
quickly and accurately for many purposes, even though these
operations must in most cases be programmed, in the absence
of floating-point hardware. We can reasonably conclude that
the medium-sized machines will serve for any use listed in
Classes 1 and 2. Certain simpler calculations of Class 3a
are also expected to prove feasible, but few, if any, of those
of Class 3b.</p>


<h3>E. ON CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF COMPUTERS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT</h3>
<p>The value of any feature depends on its need in the application
involved; therefore detailed, absolute statements
regarding each characteristic usually cannot be made. However,
the Panel has discussed various features at some length, and
we present here some general comments on the pros and cons
of these features. Among the items discussed are some, such
as word length and cycle time, that represent basic, inherent
properties of the computer; while a great many others, such
as priority interrupts, are customarily offered as options.</p>


<h4>1. Word Length</h4>
<p>The shorter the word length the cheaper the hardware, generally
speaking, but the less the accuracy in calculations
unless multiple precision is used. For example, although the
12-bit words of the PDP-8 match the accuracy of data from most
ADC's, they are too small not to match the output data from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
most counters; furthermore, indirect addressing is often required
because a single word is too short to include both the
operation code and the absolute address of a memory location.
Apart from addressing considerations, a 12-bit word is too
small for many uses, e.g., in general-purpose pulse-height
analyzer applications where 16 bits or, better, 18 bits should
be considered a minimum. Fortran programs for numerical calculations
are in general best run on machines having at least
32-bit words, although 24-bit words are usually acceptable
here when double precision can be used.</p>


<h4>2. Number of Memory Words</h4>
<p>In general the more words that a system can retain the better;
but the greater the memory, the greater the expense. The
cost must be weighed against the need. For simple handling
of data, a 4k memory may be adequate, but in a large shared-time
general-purpose machine a 16k or greater memory is essential.
In the latter case, the resident shared-time monitor
will probably occupy at least 6k of the memory, so with
a 16k memory only 10k would be left accessible to users, and
experience has shown that this much can be taken up completely
by one user compiling a Fortran IV program. A 4k memory is
adequate for many process-control applications, but it is too
small for many other applications such as general-purpose
pulse-height analyzer use, where an 8k memory is highly desirable.
Adding a supplemental rotating memory device (disk
or drum), at a cost per word about 1 percent that of core
storage, is often preferable to adding core memory.
<a href="#Page_8">See 6 below.</a></p>


<h4>3. Cycle Time</h4>
<p>For most purposes the typical memory cycle time of 1 to 2
µsec is quite adequate. Some of the modern computers have
cycle times under 1 µsec.</p>


<h4>4. Direct Data Channels</h4>
<p>These allow sequential depositing of digital data from external
devices directly into blocks of computer memory without
intervention of the central processor (direct memory access,
DMA). Such input may require only one computer cycle per
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
word, that being the next cycle after the one during which
the interrupt signal arrives. This is the fastest means of
getting data into memory, but it requires more external hardware
and more complex interfacing than input through an
accumulator of the central processor. Most data-acquisition
machines provide both possibilities. Direct data channels
can be valuable for interfacing to magnetic disks, drums, and
tapes.</p>


<h4>5. Priority Interrupts (Nested)</h4>
<p>These can be very useful. They may cost as little as $125
each, depending on the machine, and can be used to reduce
greatly the overhead running time losses of the computer. In
complicated data-taking applications many interrupt lines are
desirable; 8 to 16 priority levels are generally adequate.
The usual Fortran compiler cannot compile programs that respond
properly to interrupts, although a relocatable object
code generated by the compiler can always be assembled with
a machine-language subroutine designed to handle interrupts.
Enlargement of Fortran compilers for data-acquisition use to
include statements designed to handle interrupts is desirable.
(See, for example, the discussion of the Yale-IBM system,
<a href="#Page_33">Chapter 2, Section E.</a>)</p>


<h4>6. Mass Storage</h4>
<p>Magnetic media&mdash;drums, disks, and standard magnetic tapes&mdash;are
employed here. DEC tapes are useful and reliable, but
they have only a small capacity. The use of such microtapes
is also limited by their incompatibility with typical computer-center
equipment. Reliable, inexpensive incremental
magnetic tape units are now available which can be operated
asynchronously at about 300 Hz, too slow for many purposes.
Some of them can also be run much faster in a synchronous
mode. Drums and disks are highly desirable because they
provide program-controlled rapid access to great volumes of
data. Typically, access times are of the order of 17 µsec.
In the past few years, good and inexpensive disks have been
developed which are now on the market. Some suppliers are
IBM, CDC, Datadisk, Burroughs, DEC, and SDS. Disk storage
is cheaper per word than core storage by two orders of magnitude;
therefore, it is preferable for applications where
data can be organized serially and where access and transfer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
time requirements can be relaxed somewhat. For example, a
small DEC disk system for the PDP-8 holds up to 128k 12-bit
words and has an average access time of 17 µsec and a transfer
rate of 16,000 12-bit words per sec. It costs $6000 for
the first 32k of capacity, plus $3000 for each additional
32k, including interfacing through the direct data channel.
Larger and faster versions are available. Disks (or drums)
should be important in future systems. Magnetic tapes of
the IBM-compatible type are valuable, especially for communication
with machines at computing centers, but tape
drives and interfacing are usually expensive. It often costs
$25,000 or more to get a single tape drive in service, although
the next few are usually less expensive. The cheapest tape
drives available cost about $5000. The cost of interfacing
depends greatly on the particular computer. It may be as
little as $5000, but it is often in the neighborhood of
$15,000 or $20,000.</p>

<h4>7. Program Input Method</h4>
<p>Because they provide immediate access, the most satisfactory
program storage media are magnetic disks and drums, followed
by the IBM tape. The most satisfactory cheap device for
input of programs is the high-speed, punched-tape reader, but
the advantages of using small "cartridge-type" magnetic tapes
have recently been emphasized. Recently, card readers have
appeared which are much cheaper than the older IBM models.
They can read 200-300 cards per minute. They cost about
$2000 plus interfacing. Examples: Soroban, General Devices,
Uptime.</p>

<p>A simple means of restoring the basic loader program
(other than toggling!) is desirable. Many computers have
this feature, e.g., the IBM 360 series; the SDS Sigma 2,
Sigma 5, and 910 PDP-9.</p>

<h4>8. Memory Protection</h4>
<p>Hardware memory protection is necessary in multiprogram
systems. It is very helpful in any machine with a batch-processing
resident monitor and in other special situations.</p>

<h4>9. Parity Check</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
This feature is useful for purposes as detecting memory
failures, but it is usually not worth its cost in computer
speed and in capital investment in the case of a small
system.</p>

<h4>10. Ease and Cost of Interfacing</h4>
<p>This is a big subject, partly because the organization of
computers for input and output of data varies with the
manufacturer. Some computers such as the Hewlett-Packard
and the DEC models are especially easy to interface, whereas
the automatic channels of the SDS Sigma computers and the
ordinary IBM machines (e.g., the 360 series) are very difficult.
The IBM machines require an expensive control unit.
It is said that before a competent engineer could order plug
boards for Sigma interfacing he would have to study the
system for a month or two. However, once interfaced, these
machines permit rapid input of data. Interfacing a $5000
Calcomp plotter to the automatic channel of an IBM or Sigma
series machine may cost much more than the cost of the
plotter.</p>

<h4>11. Typewriters</h4>
<p>Many small computers use teletype machines as console typewriters.
The ASR-33 teletype has not performed well, but
it has recently been improved. The ASR-35 and KSR-35 have
excellent records, and the newer ASR-37 and KSR-37 (15 characters/sec)
are very good. The IBM Selectric has had a
mixed reliability record which is, however, improving. In
every case, expert routine maintenance is required.</p>

<h4>12. Index Registers</h4>
<p>These are a valuable asset to efficient programming. At
least one, and preferably more, is desirable, especially
in the medium and large computers.</p>

<h4>13. Line Printers</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
These are of great use for obtaining a permanent ("hard copy")
record, especially when large volumes of output are produced;
however, they are expensive, usually costing $20,000 or more
(including interfacing). In order to avoid tying up a large
central processor during typewriter output of masses of data,
a line printer is not only very useful, it is essential for
efficient operation (and to spare the typewriter). A line
printer can be <i>immensely helpful</i> and can save much time in
the process of developing and debugging programs. The cost,
however, will often preclude its addition to a modest system.
If the system has an IBM-compatible tape drive, the computer
output can be written on tape and later carried to a computing
center for printing. Several industrial concerns are known
to be working on new types of printers, some being dry-copy,
nonpercussive types. One type which has already been marketed,
the Inktronic printer, operates by spraying ink at the
paper from small tubes. The characters are well formed. It
operates at about 120 characters per second and costs $5600.
Conveniently, it requires standard Teletype interfacing, and
it can be ordered with an optional keyboard. Although it
has exhibited a few new-product ailments in its first 8
months or so of use, it shows promise of becoming a very
useful device. Another printer operating on a similar
principle has just appeared&mdash;the A.B. Dick Company's
Videojet printer, priced at about $4900.</p>

<h4>14. Plotters</h4>
<p>The overwhelming favorite is still the incremental machine
called the Calcomp plotter. It costs about $5000 and is
easily interfaced to many computers. It is very accurate
(about 0.01 in. in each direction) and provides valuable
output to the experimenter. It can be programmed to plot
experimental points and theoretical curves together on
white paper in India ink, relieving draftsmen of considerable
work and doing a more precise job. Other incremental
plotters are now on the market, e.g., the Houston
Instruments version. Varian has developed an electrostatic
plotter to sell for about $15,000.</p>

<h4>15. Cathode-Ray Tube Displays</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
At least four types are in use. The standard scheme involves
the displaying of bright spots under control of
the computer, which has generated appropriate words to
cause <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> deflections of the spot when those words have
been transformed by ADC's in the CRT unit. The pattern is
rewritten continuously. A light pen held against a particular
part of the display pattern can be used to signal the
computer. This scheme works well but may produce a flickering
image if the computer is interrupted frequently to
handle higher priority jobs or if the display is so complicated
that the rewriting period exceeds 1/30 sec. The
expensive hardware option called a character generator is
considered not worthwhile unless large amounts of text are
to be displayed. On a 10 in. x 10 in. raster a matrix of
dots 1024 x 1024 is sensible.</p>

<p>A second scheme involves a disk or drum on which the
computer writes the words to generate the pattern. Separate
reading heads send the words to the CRT unit. Thus
the display, automatically rewritten over and over, is
updated from time to time by the computer. The light-spot
cursor and joy-stick method replace the light pen in this
case. (In passing, it is worth remarking that a light pen
is only as effective as the computer program allows it to
be, that the effort of programming for light-pen control
is usually not trivial, and that a substantial amount of
core storage may be required. A means of display control
perhaps not so popular as it should be is sense-switch
control.)</p>

<p>A third scheme makes use of a modern storage CRT. The
computer sends the pattern to the CRT only once, and the
display can persist until erased. This method is flicker-free
and inexpensive, but the pattern is not so distinct
and sometimes not so bright as in the above schemes.
However, it is cheap. Furthermore, the storage tube can
be used alternately as an ordinary CRT with quite satisfactory
resolution. A storage version is thus possible
which reverts to the standard scheme, for high-resolution
inspection, when a button is pushed. The storage-tube
scheme is probably the best buy for use in a typical small
system. The Tektronix Company has recently announced a
storage-tube device, Type 4501, which is said to generate
a continuous video signal suitable for driving large-screen
television monitors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
A fourth scheme involves the generation of a video
(analog) signal corresponding to the display, written on a
disk or drum by the computer. Reading heads then send the
video information to a CRT having a TV raster synchronized
with the rotation of the medium. This is a good scheme
where many displays are needed, but it is too expensive for
many applications, costing upwards of $20,000 for the first
unit. (For example, the Data Disc System 6500 Display costs
about $23,000.)</p>

<p>One display feature considered desirable by many nuclear
physicists is rotation of isometric data plots. This can
be accomplished in one of two ways: recomputing every displayed
dot or using an appropriate analog device (potentiometer).
Because the latter is so cheap, clearly its use
is more desirable than the recomputation of the rotated
view. Also, using a light pen on a recomputed display is
especially difficult because the inverse computation has to
be performed in order to maintain proper correlation with
the original data. However, it should be noted that the
TV raster technique is limited in this respect: rotating
potentiometers cannot be used, and the image must be recomputed.
The technology of displays is developing rapidly.</p>

<h4>16. The Role of External Devices</h4>
<p>In many cases, especially where typical standard operations
are involved, it is preferable to use external devices to
handle preliminary selection and sorting of events, rather
than to ask the computer to do the entire job. For example,
particle identification by use of signals from two counters
involves one or two multiplications and additions, which
can be carried out almost instantly by a fairly simple
external analog device, whereas a small computer would
likely require at least 500 µsec for the job, assuming
calculation, and perhaps 40 µsec, assuming table look-up.</p>

<h4>17. Time Sharing</h4>
<p>Computers as small as a PDP-8 have been successfully time-shared
by several users in special applications. The justification
given is that all the peripheral hardware can be
shared also, so that the added constraints and programming
difficulties are balanced by savings in hardware costs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Computers have also been shared for simultaneous on-line
data-taking in low-data-rate experiments. In working out
the economics of time-sharing, the added hardware (such as
CRT's and remote consoles and memory protection) needed to
allow simultaneous access by more than one user, as well as
the extra memory space needed by the time-sharing monitor,
should be considered. The greatest costs, however, lie in
the added constraints placed on each of the users and in
the greatly increased cost of programming. In many cases
the use of two or more identical computers is preferable.
However, in large, expensive systems time-sharing can be
very useful.</p>


<h4>18. Software That Should Be Supplied by Manufacturer</h4>
<p>Complete documentation should be provided, including listings,
step-by-step user instructions, and some fully worked
out examples.</p>

<p>a. Hardware diagnostic routines: To test memory addressing,
instruction set and to test correct operation of
every peripheral and special hardware feature.</p>
<p>b. Systems to edit, assemble, and debug programs in
symbolic machine language: These should efficiently use
any special I/O device such as magnetic tape, disk, or
line printer.</p>
<p>c. Efficient subroutines should be provided for
operation of any special peripheral device purchased from
the computer manufacturer. Symbolic language source tapes
or card decks, listings with comments, and examples of use
should be included.</p>
<p>d. Conversational Fortran-type programs provided by
some manufactures are useful for supplemental calculations.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> The following points apply particularly to the
medium and large machines and become increasingly important
as the computer becomes larger and more complex.</p>

<p>e. Fortran compiler and operating system, with convenient
method to insert machine language instructions and
subroutines. Good compile and run-time diagnostics are
essential.</p>
<p>f. Mathematical subroutines should be provided in
binary and source language.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
g. Complete specifications and documentation for the
programming system should be supplied, so that programs
prepared by users can be made compatible. It may be objected
that this will cost too much, but not to do so will
be very costly and frustrating to many users.</p>

<h4>19. Note on the Cost of Programming</h4>
<p>Experience at Brookhaven and Berkeley has shown that a
programmer can produce between 10 and 20 debugged and
documented lines of program per day, depending on such
factors as experience, when he is working on reasonably
straightforward programming. When working on a complicated
monitor system he would be considerably less productive.
System programming is obviously very expensive, therefore
the average person exploring the computer market would be
well advised to consider the software support along with
the hardware offered in each case. Manufacturers vary
greatly in this respect. A major contributing factor to
the persistent popularity of the PDP-8 is that the software
support is so extensive. <i>In general, the newer a computer,
the less software is likely to be available.</i></p>

DATA-ACQUISITION SYSTEMS</h2>

<h3>A. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<h4>1. History</h4>
<p>The movement toward computer systems began in earnest about
1962. Much of the early work depended on the use of magnetic
tape for storage of data, either raw or partially digested,
the analysis of data being carried out later, off-line. More
recently, computers have been used increasingly for on-line
processing. The early work is well known and will not be
described here. Some of the more recent systems are basically
very close descendants of one or another of the early
systems. Many varieties are now in service. Most incorporate
small or medium-sized computers, however, extensive new experience
has been gained during the past two or three years
of operation of a few large time-shared systems, in particular
those in the tandem Van de Graaff accelerator laboratories at
Yale and at Rochester, perhaps the first large systems in
operation which were planned systematically for nuclear research.
Both operate with multiprogramming monitor control,
background calculations being possible, on a low-priority
basis, simultaneously with data acquisition.</p>

<h4>2. Possible Systems</h4>
<p>Simple rules for the design of various types of data-acquisition
systems cannot be stated, but some examples of possible
systems can be given. (<a href="#Page_17">See Figure 1.</a>)</p>

<p>a. A simple system for pulse-height analysis work can
be assembled from a small computer, a 5-in. Tektronix CRO,
an ADC unit, and a teletype with paper-tape attachment for a
cost of about $30,000, providing that a competent engineer is
available, not counting programming and engineering costs. A
Calcomp plotter could be added for about $6000. To maintain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and operate the system at least a half-time technician-programmer
would be required.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus-17.png" width="600" height="264" alt="" />
<p class="center"><b>FIGURE 1</b>&emsp;Basic data-acquisition system.</p>
</div>

<p>b. A general-purpose system for use in an accelerator
laboratory can be assembled from a medium-sized computer,
two typewriters, four 13-bit (0-8192) ADC's, six 18-bit
(0-262,144) counters, a 10 in. x 10 in. CRO display unit
with light pen, two tape drives (for IBM tape), a Calcomp
plotter, and a fast paper-tape reader for about $175,000 plus
the cost of engineering service and programming. At least one
full-time technician-programmer would be needed for maintenance
and programming.</p>

<p>c. A large shared-time system of the smallest configuration
which makes much sense consists of a large computer
with a 16k memory, two typewriters, a fast punched-tape
reader, four DEC tapes (or the equivalent), one IBM-compatible
magnetic tape, one CRO with light pen, one incremental plotter,
input devices for experimental data (ADC's, counters, etc.),
plus an interfacing system to link the external input-output
devices to the computer. The interfacing system may include
a fixed-wired "front end," such as that used at Yale, a small
computer, such as that used at Rochester, or both. The hardware
would probably cost over $400,000 exclusive of engineering,
and to this must be added a large expense for programming,
even if the manufacturer supplies a satisfactory shared-time
monitor plus all the usual software. Three men would be
needed to assemble, maintain, and operate the system: an
engineer, technician-programmer, and a full-time programmer,
or some equivalent combination, assuming use of the system
in a large laboratory with an active and continually developing
research program. Thus the cost of this "stripped-down"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
system must be expected to reach $500,000 before it is in full
operation, and the cost of keeping it going, including salaries,
overhead, and replacement parts will likely exceed $50,000 per
year, although this could perhaps be trimmed somewhat once the
system is running. Furthermore, to run efficiently, the system
would need additional components: another 16k (at least) of
core memory, another IBM-compatible magnetic-tape drive, and
a line printer. A rotating memory device would also be helpful.
These would raise the cost by well over $100,000. It
is apparent that large time-shared systems are so expensive
that they can ordinarily be justified only in the largest,
most lively research establishments.</p>

<h4>3. Small Computers as Satellites</h4>
<p>In medium and large systems the use of small computers for
coupling input and output devices to the main computer offers
a number of attractive advantages, especially now that mass
production and competition have brought the prices down so
low that a large amount of hardware nearly ideal for the
purpose is available at a bargain. Some advantages:
(1) The small machine can control data acquisition, accumulating
blocks of data while the large machine is doing
background calculations, interrupting those calculations only
occasionally to transfer raw or partially processed data.
(2) The small machine can continuously control the monitor
CRO. (3) It can control output devices such as a plotter,
line printer, rotating memory, or tape drive. (4) It can
carry out many logic operations on the incoming data. Experience
has shown that such operations are numerous, and
from the economic point of view they should not be allowed
to tie up the larger machine, which, at the same time, can
better be engaged in complicated calculations. In some cases
the use of two small satellite computers can easily be justified.
The chief disadvantage: Programming can be complicated.
However, if the larger machine already has a time-shared
monitor which recognizes the small machine as a typical
input-output device (as is the case with the PDP-6 plus PDP-8
system at Rochester) the programming problem is not bad.</p>

<p>In the following five sections descriptions of a number
of data-acquisition systems of various types and sizes will
be given in order to illustrate concretely some practical
system configurations. In each case a breakdown of costs
and a discussion of the lessons learned in connection with
planning, construction, and operation will be included. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
systems are of the following types: two small, one medium,
one large, two multiple-CPU, and one process control.</p>


<h3>B. A SMALL TIME-SHARED DATA-ACQUISITION SYSTEM BASED ON A PDP-7 COMPUTER</h3>
<h4>1. Introduction</h4>
<p>In 1966, two identical computer systems based on PDP-7 computers
were set up in two different locations at the Lawrence
Radiation Laboratory (LRL), to be used by several groups of
experimenters (see Figure 2). Assembly of the hardware for
the first system was completed 6 months after delivery of
the computer. Assembly of the second system required only
3 months. Two years after operation commenced, the first
satisfactory time-sharing monitor was completed and put into
service. The basic use of these systems is pulse-height analysis.
In principle many other types of operation are possible.</p>

<h4>2. Operational Features</h4>
<p>Data-reduction jobs currently possible in the shared-time
operating mode include spectrum stripping, normalization,
smoothing, storage and retrieval of data from magnetic tapes,
graph plotting, printout, energy calibration, background
fitting, peak integration, and transfer of data from a remote
analyzer. Remote control of the computer from up to eight
experimental locations is possible using inexpensive switch
panels (Figure 3). Remote slave CRT display is also provided.
Multiparameter pulse-height acquisition and analysis can be
done on a time-shared basis but often requires all the computer's
time and memory.</p>


<h4>3. Hardware</h4>
<p>The hardware configuration is shown in Figure 2. The PDP-7
computer was supplied by the Digital Equipment Corporation
with an 8k memory (18 bits) extended arithmetic hardware,
microtape (Dectape), paper tape, teletype, and cathode-ray
tube (CRT). The other items were built or interfaced at LRL.</p>

<p>Automatic memory increment and memory-protection hardware,
together with suitable programming, allow a user to carry out
simple data-reduction jobs with a live CRT display while two
other users are independently acquiring separate, 2048-channel,
pulse-height spectra in part of the computer memory, with
computer-controlled-gain stabilization. ADC dead time per
pulse is less that 40 µsec. Up To 6144 words of the memory
can be used for data (one PHA channel per word), while machine
language programs fill the remaining 2048 words of memory.</p>


<h4>4. Lessons Learned from Operating Experience</h4>
<p>The system works well for pulse-height analysis, but for new
applications, e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance magnet control,
it needs additional hardware and programs.</p>

<p>Two groups of experimenters, doing chiefly pulse-height
analysis experiments are very satisfied with the system.
Another group, with a wider range of interests, has been
dissatisfied because of the time lag to implement new experiments.</p>

<p>One programmer is now engaged full time preparing more
programs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Lack of free computer time has become a limitation for
both users and programmers.</p>

<p>Provision for programming at the outset was inadequate.
One full-time systems programmer should have been assigned
to these systems for 18 months.</p>

<p>Experimenters need Fortran or similar language capability.
A disk, or more core memory, would make this
practical.</p>

<p>The memory size is totally inadequate for multiple users
because of the large amount of data space needed for the high-resolution
spectra now obtainable with Ge(Li) detectors. An
external 8k memory is being acquired for data acquisition in
each system so that more of the computer memory can be used
for computing.</p>

<p>Memory CRT's are needed to provide independent displays
for each user. A separate teletype for each user would be
invaluable.</p>

<p>A disk memory is needed for rapid overlay of programs and
for sorting of multiparameter data.</p>

<p>A "czar" should have been appointed for day-to-day assignment
of facilities, consultations with users, and routine
maintenance and upkeep of the hardware and programs. The
"czar" could be a good electronics technician interested
both in programming and in physics.</p>

<h4>5. Costs</h4>
<p>System costs for the PDP-7 with time-sharing are given in
Table 1. Fabrication time is included as a dollar cost.
Engineering and programming times shown are one half those
charged against two identical systems.</p>

<p>Additional special-purpose experimental equipment commonly
used with the system includes gain stabilizers, analog
pulse derandomizers, amplifiers, pulse pileup rejection,
low-noise preamplifiers, and Ge(Li) detectors.</p>

<h3>C. A SMALL SYSTEM BASED ON A PDP-8 COMPUTER</h3>
<h4>1. History and Hardware</h4>

<p>This second example of a small computer system is also taken
from experience at LRL. It was planned in February 1967 and
first put into operation in the summer of 1967. Data were
first taken with the aid of the system in the spring of 1968,
and the system programming was completed in May 1969. The
system is used extensively in experiments with the Bevatron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus-24.png" width="700" height="497" alt="" />
<p class="center"><b>FIGURE 4</b>&emsp; PDP-8 data-acquisition system at Lawrence Radiation Laboratory.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>The computer-system hardware consists of the items shown
in Figure 4. The PDP-8 has 4k of memory. The disk is a Data
Disc unit with a removable disk (128 tracks and a movable
head) on the same shaft as a smaller disk and three fixed data
heads. Two of the fixed-head tracks are devoted to the display:
they drive a hardware-translator continuously. A single display
track is used when the number of points does not exceed
2000. For larger displays two tracks are used alternately.</p>

<p>The display is controlled from the switch panel. On-line
operating functions may be controlled both from the switch
panel and from the teletype.</p>

<h4>2. Programming</h4>

<p>Three classes of programming have been completed:</p>

<p><i>System Programs</i>: Symbolic Text Editor, Assembler, a general-purpose
library system&mdash;all disk oriented.</p>

<p><i>Data-Taking Programs</i>: These cause the ADC to be read, control
elementary sorting, update histograms resident on the disk,
write raw data on tape, and monitor the beam. The Bevatron
has approximately 1 sec of beam every 6 sec. During a beam
pulse the computer is devoted entirely to acquiring data,
saving raw data in core, on the disk, and on tape. After a
beam pulse, the 13-disk histograms are updated, then the
display programs are read into core memory and the display
is updated. The system is designed to be capable of accepting
over 1000 events per beam burst, and it has met this
requirement.</p>

<p><i>Simple Data-Analysis Programs</i>: These compute displays (linear,
log, isometric, and contour&mdash;all double precision), read out
the sealers, monitor the real-time clock, allow resorting of
raw data from tape, and generate tapes for remote plotting.</p>

<h4>3. Lessons from Operating Experience</h4>

<p>The system now functions as originally intended and does its
job very satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The experimenter relies heavily on the main computer center
for data processing.</p>

<p>In assembling this system now, one would buy the disk already
interfaced by the computer manufacturer; furthermore
the manufacturer now offers programs that would greatly reduce
the programming costs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
A memory scope would eliminate the need for a disk-to-CRT
display interface.</p>

<p>Less-expensive magnetic tapes are now available. However,
it would be better to buy the tape already interfaced by the
manufacturer of the computer.</p>

<p>The added cost of buying a 16-or 18-bit computer would
have been almost completely offset by savings in the cost of
programming.</p>

<p>The addition of a fast printer (e.g., Inktronic $5600)
would have paid for itself in time saved during programming
but would not be of much use in experiment.</p>

<h4>4. Costs</h4>

<h3>D. A MEDIUM-SIZED ON-LINE COMPUTER SYSTEM</h3>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

<p>An EMR 6130 computer system has been installed and is being
prepared for use with Columbia University's Neutron Velocity
Spectrometer data-acquisition and analysis system. The
spectrometer is characterized by high data rates and many
events per burst. At present, peak arrival rates are approximately
10<sup>6</sup> events per second, with 40-60 events per burst
and a burst rate of 70 Hz. The arrival distribution is
random; therefore, 10 percent of the interarrival intervals
are 100 nsec long, and 1 percent are 10 nsec long. In the
future, peak arrival rates of 10<sup>7</sup> events/sec and 400-600
events per burst are possible, with a burst rate of 300 Hz.
With an appropriate time-of-flight "front end," the 6130 will
be able to handle the anticipated faster rates.</p>

<p>The EMR 6130 is a 16-bit, 775-nsec computer. The memory
has a multibus structure which permits each bus to communicate
simultaneously with a separate memory module. Up to four
memory buses may be purchased. The Columbia system has two
memory buses. If a high-speed buffered data channel is used,
block transfer may occur at memory cycle speeds. With two
buses, data may be stored in two memory modules at rates up
to twice memory speed. Alternatively, one bus, channel, and
one or more memory modules may be dedicated to data acquisition,
while the central processor and standard peripheral
devices, using the second bus, simultaneously operate in the
remaining memory modules.</p>


<h4>2. Description of the System</h4>

<p>A block diagram of the Columbia system is given in Figure 5.
The system has three 8k core modules. Memory bus 1 is dedicated
to a high-speed channel serving the time-of-flight
acquisition system. Memory bus 2 serves both the central
processor and a second high-speed channel. Low-speed input-output
devices, such as the operator's console, teletype,
card reader, and plotter communicate directly through the
processor. The high-speed input-output devices, namely, a
magnetic tape unit, line printer, fixed head disk, and interactive
CRT display, communicate through the channel.</p>

<p>The box designated as "time-of-flight system" represents
special-purpose electronics, including a 50-mHz clock, time-quantizing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
circuits which "clock" an input event from one of
the detectors to the nearest clock pulse following its arrival,
a 50-mHz counter, and a 16-word derandomizing buffer capable
of storing a new word of data (i.e., arrival time) every
20 nsec. The number of channels, nominally 16,000, is limited
not by the front end but by the amount of core available for
histogram storage in the 6130 system. (For the high data
rates anticipated in the future, the time-of-flight clock
speed and derandomizing buffer data acceptance rate will be
increased to 100 mHz. At the same time, an accumulating
buffer of several hundred words capacity, with a 20-mHz data
acceptance rate, will be added to empty the derandomizing
buffer and store temporarily the time-of-arrival data prior
to its transmission to the 6130 system.)</p>

<p class="center"><b>FIGURE 6</b>&emsp;Diagram illustrating mode of utilization of
core memory in the Columbia System shown in Figure 5.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>


<h4>3. How the System is Used</h4>

<p>During the time-of-flight experiment, memory is utilized as
follows (see Figure 6). The channel dedicated to data acquisition
writes on alternate bursts, into two buffer regions,
of approximately 100 words each, in the top of memory module
3. The remaining parts of memory module 3 and all module 2
will be devoted to histogram storage (i.e., time-of-flight
channels). Module 1 will contain a stripped-down monitor
program and all data-handling programs, including buffer
regions for the external devices other than the time-of-flight
front end. Programs will be capable of referring to all module
1 or 2 in full concurrency with data acquisition. Reference
to module 3 will also overlap data acquisition, except
for a period of high input data rate of 100-to 200-µsec duration
per burst. With the type of memory allocation described,
the system will permit the use of all standard I/O
devices, concurrent with the essential operations of input data
buffering and histogram generation. Thus, new data may be
stored on, or old data retrieved from, the disk or magnetic
tape; either new or old data may be displayed on the CRT; and
the same or other data may be output with the plotter or line
printer. Control information will be input from the teletype,
the operator's console, or from special-purpose switches.
The importance to the physicist is that hard copy output is
immediately available during data acquisition and may be used
to monitor, or modify, the experiment.</p>

<p>Subsequent to the input data increase, a high-speed
memory incrementing channel will be used to input time-of-flight
data directly to the histogram area. With this channel
the buffer area in module 3 will no longer be required.
Histogram data will be stored in all modules 2 and 3, and no
program intervention will be required for histogram generation.</p>

<p>Between data-acquisition runs, the system will be used
for data analysis.</p>


<h4>4. Present Status</h4>

<p>The computer, with two memory modules and one channel and bus,
was delivered in July 1968. The remaining memory module
channel and bus were delivered in the fall of 1968, the CRT
arrived in June 1969, and the line printer (which was not
purchased from EMR) came shortly afterward. The first time-of-flight
run with this system was scheduled for December 1969.
During the period from delivery to the first run, one full-time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
programmer and approximately half the time of one physicist
were devoted to the debugging of manufacturer-supplied
programs and the writing of the on-line programs required for
the run.</p>

<p>It has been hoped that the system would be used extensively
for the analysis of previously acquired data, beginning
shortly after delivery; however, very little such use has
proved possible, essentially because of the unreliability of
the 100-cpm card reader supplied by EMR. The lack of a line
printer was also a factor. A more reliable reader has been
purchased. The delivery of a line printer should rectify the
second need.</p>

<p>The development of high-speed, buffered, time-of-flight
front ends has been a continuing interest at Columbia. It is
therefore difficult to estimate the precise costs of the time-of-flight
system developed for use with the 6130. A rough
estimate of the design and development time is approximately
3 engineer man years.</p>


<h4>5. Lessons from Development and Testing Experience</h4>

<p>Columbia chose to order the EMR 6130, even though at that
time (1966) it was not in production, because it seemed a
very powerful machine which matched the needs of the system
planners. The alternate possibility open was to order a
larger, much more expensive machine of proven capability. As
it turned out, difficulties in the development of the 6130
caused a delay of over a year in the delivery of the main
frame and of over two years in the delivery of the CRT display.
(When these delays became apparent, EMR loaned Columbia a
24-bit computer and also a small display for use during the
interim period.) The EMR 6130 is perhaps the most powerful
16-bit computer available today, in spite of one or two
changes in the original specifications, but in order to get
it Columbia apparently traded time for money.</p>


<h4>6. Cost</h4>

<p>The costs of the Columbia University EMR 6130 system are

<h3>E. A LARGE SYSTEM BASED ON A SINGLE COMPUTER (THE YALE-IBM NUCLEAR-DATA-ACQUISITION SYSTEM)</h3>


<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

<p>Since early 1966, Yale and IBM Research have been engaged in
a joint study in the application of computers to nuclear-data
acquisition. The main goal was the production of an integrated
hardware-software system which is fully under the control
of the experimenter in the sense that he can define his
entire data acquisition and analysis process with a Fortran
program.</p>

<p>The joint study may be divided into four areas: (1)
Development of a suitable general and powerful data-acquisition
interface and control unit (front end) with a set of
compatible nuclear instrumentation modules (scalers, ADC's,
and general-purpose input registers). (2) Development of a
suitable display system. (3) Development of a data-acquisition
language (as an extension to Fortran) and the necessary
library routines to support this language. (4) Development
of a general-purpose multiprogramming system for the selected
computer (the IBM System/360, Model 44) into which the data-acquisition
system could be incorporated.</p>

<p>The first three areas became operational in July 1967,
within three months after delivery of the computer, using the
standard batch programming system for the 360/44 as a basis.
Development continues on the multiprogramming system, which
has now reached a state where users inexperienced in using
the system can compile and execute Fortran programs, but the
data-acquisition components are not yet operational.</p>


<h4>2. Description of the System</h4>

<p>Nuclear data are input by means of a general-purpose
nuclear-data-acquisition interface and control unit, organized around
the concept of an event, an occurrence in the real world which
causes the outputs of a group of instruments selected by the
user to be read into computer memory. Sixteen independent
events are provided for, with each of which may be associated
any or all of 30 different instruments (scalers, ADC's, or
general-purpose monitor registers) by means of a diode plug
board matrix. The instruments themselves, also designed and
built by IBM, are modular and completely interchangeable and
enable the experimenter to configure his experiment in any
way desired, i.e., to determine not only which instruments
are to be read but also in what order. Exclusion logic is
provided to prevent processing of certain events if and when
other defined events occur simultaneously (Figure 7).</p>

<p>The cathode-ray-tube display unit provides a 1024 x 1024
point plotting oscilloscope with seven levels of intensity,
character-generation hardware, a light pen, and a programmed
function keyboard, by means of which the user can call in
programs by pushing buttons. Such programs can perform any
function from changing displays gains to curve-fitting. They
may be system-supplied or user-written and may be (and usually
are) written Fortran. A parallel, high-resolution photographic
system permits computer assembly of publication quality illustrations.</p>

<p>The data-acquisition and display-programming system is
composed of a group of subroutines which may be called from
Fortran programs for performing the various processes in data
acquisition and display. For this purpose, a considerable
number of additional statements have been added to the Fortran
language. These statements perform such functions as defining
multidimensional pulse-height analyzers in the computer memory,
performing pulse-height analysis using incoming data as channel
numbers, and defining separate programs to process each of
the 16 classes of input events. All the special statements
that make up the new data-acquisition language are implemented
by means of a preprocessor which converts them into Fortran
coding, which the standard 360/44 Fortran compiler then
processes.</p>

<h4>3. Software System</h4>

<p>The general-purpose multiprogramming operating system is a
multilevel priority system designed to provide access to the
system simultaneously by an, in principle, unlimited number
of users, each with unique priority. Unlimited means that
there is no arbitrary restriction on the number of users;
the nth user can always get access if the facilities his
particular job requires are not already in use. Two types of
user are recognized by the system: The basic unit of execution
is the logical user, or task. Each logical user has a unique
priority level. Switching between users is carried out as a
response to I/O, timer, or external interrupts, at which time
the highest priority user in a position to execute gains control
of the central processor. The basic unit of memory protection
is the physical user, composed of one or more logical
users engaged in a common cause. Physical users correspond
to real people doing independent work simultaneously. By
dividing his work up among a group of logical users, a person
may take advantage of the parallel processing capabilities of
the system in a natural way. Since logical users within a
physical user are not memory-protected against each other,
they may communicate rapidly, at full machine speed. Communication
between different physical users is also possible,
via real or simulated I/O devices. While this system by no
means guarantees execution time to any but the highest priority
user, it is adequate in a single-experiment environment.
The assumption is that the experimenter, who has actual control
of the computer at all times, loads his logical users
in the order in which he requires their priorities. Following
this, other users load their jobs, getting whatever memory and
I/O facilities remain. The amount of processor time available
to the other users varies inversely with the experimenter's
counting rate and the amount of processing he does on his data.
In most experiments, the experimenter uses significantly less
than 50 percent of the processor time simply because those
experiments requiring the sophistication of the computer also
have rather low counting rates. <i>A priori</i>, it is estimated
that the simple priority algorithm described above is not only
adequate but pays a dividend in terms of reduced system overhead
time as compared to a more elaborate algorithm. It also
guarantees that no data will be lost due to the lower priority
users being in the machine.</p>

<p>In general the new system will provide all the facilities
of 44PS within the multiprogramming framework, including execution
of the Fortran compiler simultaneously with data
acquisition.</p>

<h4>4. Costs</h4>

<p>To the laboratory interested in developing a system of the
magnitude of the Yale system, but not a copy, it must be
reiterated that neither Yale's out-of-pocket costs nor the
cost of copying the system represents the total cost of development.
IBM's development costs are not known, but they
may be assumed to be very large.</p>

<p>From IBM's viewpoint, the ADC and scaler project is the
least successful part of the whole project. Although those
instruments are technically excellent, IBM is either unwilling
or unable to sell them at a price competitive with the costs
of front-end and interface equipment available from the traditional
nuclear instrument manufacturers. However, ADC's
and scalers available from the traditional sources can easily
be interfaced to the front end (whose price is in keeping with
its power and versatility). The University of Maryland has
followed this procedure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>We therefore present the cost of copying the Yale system
by some other laboratory. In Tables 4 and 5 following the
example of Maryland, we have not selected IBM ADC's and scalers
but rather less expensive components from traditional manufacturers,
together with suitable adapters available commercially.
The prices shown are to be considered strictly reference
numbers and in no way constitute price quotations.</p>


<h4>5. General Comments on Experience with the System</h4>

<p>Starting by producing an operational data-acquisition software
system running within the standard batch programming system for
the 360/44 enabled the system to become operational within
three months of the delivery of the computer. This not only
enabled it to do useful work almost immediately but also enabled
important experience to be gained which is being applied
to the development of the multiprogrammed version.</p>

<p>One of the main lessons so far is that a batch-oriented
system barely begins to tap the real-time potentials of a
computer such as the 360/44. In a batch system, whatever
analysis is needed during data acquisition must be somehow
tied to the processing of events. If this is not possible,
it is necessary to stop data acquisition in order to do
analysis even though, on a millisecond time scale, plenty of
CPU time is available during acquisition. Multiprogramming
software is necessary in order to utilize this available
time. This means that multiprogramming not only makes the
machine available to several people at a time, but, more
important, it makes large amounts of parallel processing power
available to the experimenter.</p>

<p>It has also been shown quite conclusively that the ability
of the physicist to program his own experiment (in Fortran)
gives him enormous power, power which simply would not be
available on a suitable time scale if he has to queue up for
the services of a system programmer.</p>

<p>While the generalized event structure gives the experimenter
considerable ability to deal with complex experimental
situations, it has an overhead associated with it which limits
it to about 5000 events per second. This is, of course, adequate
for all experiments that demand such an event structure.
For simple pulse-height analysis, it is unnecessary overhead,
but it can be "turned off" in a trivial way, by simply defining
the completion of filling of the buffer as an event
and calling a special pulse-height-analysis program to process
the entire buffer, bypassing the event sorting. This allows
for close to 100,000 pulse-height analyses per second.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>There are, however, few situations that justify using a
computer as powerful as the 360/44 in a manner just described
(i.e., doing nothing but simple addition 100,000 times per
second). Therefore, such simple experiments will shortly be
handled by means of a link between an existing multichannel
analyzer and the computer.</p>

<p>The system does not suffer from having the front end
directly connected to the 360/44. The data channel on the
360/44 is sufficiently sophisticated so that it performs all
the functions that one might relegate to a small CPU placed
between the front end and the 360/44, without any interference
with the program currently running in the CPU. The one application
described above, which does warrant a separate processor,
is handled best by attaching the processor to a separate
input port rather than by placing it between the front end
and the computer. This enables it to do its intended job
without acting as a bottleneck in jobs requiring the power
of the front end. It also, incidentally, will function as a
completely separate data input terminal if two simultaneous
terminals should ever be required.</p>

<p>The particular display system employed has worked very
well. Because the display list is in the main memory of the
computer, programming of light-pen and other manipulative
actions is extremely easy, but at the price of large amounts
of memory being tied up. It is clear that the system cannot
support two such terminals if they are to be truly independent
of each other. It is equally clear that the display is as
useful in data analysis as it is in data acquisition. A second
display terminal is therefore being added. The selected
unit (built by Computer Displays, Inc.) is oriented around
the Tektronix 611 storage oscilloscope. It provides both
alphameric and graphic display, as well as an interactive
device (a cursor moved by means of a joystick) for a price
of $8000 to $12,000 plus the cost of interfacing to the computer.</p>


<h3>F. MULTIPLE-COMPUTER SYSTEMS</h3>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

<p>At the Rutgers-Bell (RB) nuclear physics laboratory, work has
been done with two different two-CPU systems. The first of
these represented essentially two duplicate processors (Figure
8), and the second, now in the process of implementation, two
processors of different size and capability (Figure 9). While
full data are not yet available on the actual performance of
the second system, an outline of the experience to date will
be given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><b>FIGURE 8</b>&emsp;The two-central-processor system of Rutgers-Bell.</p>
</div>


<h4>2. Two Equivalent Processors</h4>

<p>The initial success of the original RB SDS 910 data-acquisition
system was soon tempered by a result of its popularity: during
most experiments the computer was unavailable for program development
or data analysis. Since most experiments required
the use of displays and light pens in at least one stage of
data analysis, the computer center could not handle the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus-41.png" width="700" height="489" alt="" />
<p class="center"><b>FIGURE 9</b>&emsp;The new Rutgers-Bell Sigma 2-Sigma 5 system.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
<p>The solution adopted was to acquire another computer with the
same instruction set (an SDS 925) and to provide switches such
that the line printer, card reader, and plotter could be run
from either computer. No provision was made for direct transfer
of data from one computer to the other.</p>


<h4>3. Lessons from Operating Experience</h4>

<p>In practice this system worked out quite well. There was
complete interchangeability of programs from the 910 to the
925, which differed only in being five times faster. Normally
the switchable peripherals were run from the 925; when the
group taking data wished to print or plot current spectra,
they consulted with the 925 users, then used the peripherals
with little more difficulty than permanently attached units
would have involved.</p>

<p>A further advantage of the switchable peripherals, in
addition to the cost saving, was that the experiments associated
with the 910 could proceed while the peripherals were
being serviced. The 910 is exceedingly reliable, averaging
less that one main frame failure per year, and the 925 is
nearly as reliable. The vast majority of service calls have
been occasioned by the peripherals and have competed with data
analysis but not with accelerator utilization.</p>

<p>In addition to the switched peripherals, both computers
were equipped with two magnetic tape transports, electric
typewriter, and high-speed paper-tape reader and punch. While
these units were also subject to downtime, the paper-tape
system and the typewriter could be exchanged between the 910
and 925. Only the magnetic-tape transports required the use
of the 910 CPU during servicing, and the presence of two
transports has usually meant that the second one could carry
the load until the weekly accelerator maintenance period.</p>

<p>While the reliability record of the central processors
has been excellent, that of many of the peripherals has not.
Here is an excellent justification for renting computing
equipment: if units do not work well, they can be returned.
For a time, a low-cost card reader (100 cards per minute)
built by NCR for SDS was used. It was unacceptable in reliability
and was replaced by the Univac reader which came with
the 925. Another unit returned was a cartridge magnetic-tape
system built by SDS. The Ampex TM-4 magnetic-tape transports
on both the 910 and 925 have been consistently poor in reliability,
but no other unit has been available to replace them.
A manufacturer's name does not seem to be a guarantee of good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
or bad quality&mdash;the line printer, also made by NCR, has been
excellent both in reliability and print quality.</p>


<h4>4. Limitations on a Twin-Computer System</h4>

<p>While the two-computer system generally rated high in user
satisfaction, considerations of performance have led to the
design of a larger and more powerful system with totally new
components. The 925, without wired multiplication or floating-point
operations, was too slow for theoretical computation or
for many types of data analysis such as those using Monte Carlo
methods. Interactive methods of analysis, using a display and
light pen, have been found very effective in the cases where
the 925 could accommodate them but have not been available
through either the Bell Laboratories or Rutgers computer centers.</p>

<p>A further limitation on the earlier system was that only
one person could use the 925 at a time. The generation of a
display involved the full time of the CPU, and while multiprogramming
might have been able to divert some CPU time, the
8k memory size did not permit it.</p>

<p>Data acquisition on the 910 was limited in array size to
the capacity of the core memory. For multiparameter experiments,
three, six, or even twelve 4096-channel arrays have
been stored in core, but the advantages of live display available
with core storage have discouraged anyone from handling
large arrays by logging raw data on magnetic tape for analysis
later. Memory expansion would have been desirable, but the
necessity of making the expansion on both the 910 and the 925
effectively doubled the cost.</p>

<p>Limited flexibility, then, is a major drawback of this
type of system. As long as only two users needed to be accommodated,
and each could adapt to exactly half of the total core
storage, it was satisfactory and provided redundant facilities
to guard against experiment downtime due to computer failures.</p>


<h4>5. New Directions</h4>

<p>In ordering a new computer powerful enough to handle most of
the nuclear physics laboratory's data analysis and theoretical
computing tasks, cost ruled out the acquisition of a pair of
program-compatible computers. It was recognized that desirable
features of the original system would have to be obtained in
new ways. Accessibility of the system for programming could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
be improved by running a simple time-sharing monitor on it.
Reliability could be enhanced by avoiding bargain peripherals
and using only items of demonstrated high quality and by the
capability of running the peripherals on either computer.</p>

<p>The use of a separate CPU for data collection still
seemed particularly desirable, however. A combination of a
large (by present standards) computer with a powerful small
computer as a front end was designed. It includes a display
disk for refreshing displays without CPU attention, as well
as for storing data arrays too large to be kept in core. The
computers selected were a 32k, 32-bit SDS Sigma 5 and a 12k,
16-bit Sigma 2.</p>

<p>The new system, with separate and nonequivalent computers,
will have advantages over the old system in data analysis and
general computation, because these will be done on the larger
computer, either in time sharing or batch mode. Time sharing
should enhance the flexibility of the system by making it
easier to generate and debug new programs, in addition to
improving the accessibility.</p>

<p>For the data-collection computer, RB will lose the advantage
of a separate computer on which complete debugging of
programs may be done. This loss can be tolerated since the
fraction of the load carried by the Sigma 2 will be less than
that carried by the 910 in the old system. In the old system,
very few distinct data input or display programs were written.
A few subroutines and their calling parameters sufficed for
all needs for six years; the logic and I/O operations unique
to each experiment were written in Fortran by the experimenters.</p>

<p>In the new system, the Sigma 2 will be concerned with the
operations used in the data acquisition and formating of displays;
most of the rest can be left in the Sigma 5, with routines
sent over to the Sigma 2 under the time-sharing system.
If the user should prefer, he can operate the Sigma 2 directly
and make use of the Sigma 5 only for data storage.</p>

<p>Until very recently, program development on the Sigma 2
has been slow because it lacked means of getting program listings
quickly. We have now developed an assembler for the
Sigma 2 which runs on the Sigma 5. The availability of card
reader input and line printer output has greatly speeded Sigma
2 software development. The loading of Sigma 2 programs is
also much more convenient, since they can be stored on the
Sigma 5 disk and loaded exactly as Sigma 5 programs. It seems
highly desirable to have an assembler for any small data-acquisition
computer capable of running on another machine; the
means of transporting the object code to the small computer
is of less importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>The reliability of the new equipment has been excellent.
Only the card reader has had any downtime of consequence, and
modifications seem to have resolved its problems. The Sigma
5 main frame has had no failures in 12 months, and the Sigma
2 has had only one in the past year. If this record continues,
the loss of the redundancy inherent in the old 910/925 system
will not have any serious effects.</p>


<h4>6. Computer-Independent Data Bus System</h4>

<p>One component of the new system is taking on an increasingly
important role, although it had not been a part of the original
planning. That is the computer-independent data bus consisting
of system controller, bin controller, and register
units. Only the system controller is specific to a particular
computer; moreover the same system controller design could be
used on both the Sigma 2 and Sigma 5 by restricting the data
path to 16 bits. The register units are used to interface
external devices to the computer quite cheaply; a typical
register used here to interface an existing Calcomp plotter
to the new computers costs about $300 in parts and labor.
Similar units are used to interface the Sigma 5 to the Sigma
2 and to the 910, to drive a temporary core-resident display
on the Sigma 5, to read pushbutton inputs, and to read ADC's.
The display disk controller now under construction uses these
registers to furnish control information, although the data
go directly to and from the core.</p>

<p>At the present time, the registers are read and written
under program interrupt control, but the design is not limited
to program-controlled operation. By substituting a controller
designed to operate automatically (directly to core or to the
I/O processor) speeds approaching 1 or 2 µsec per word transferred
could be obtained. Such interfaces have been built for
various computers using the European CAMAC bus system, which
is conceptually similar.</p>

<p>The system is highly modular and is built into NIM bins
with modified back connectors. Exchange of modular units has
been very helpful in debugging the system, and presumably it
will also be helpful in case of failures in operation. This
is a much more satisfactory situation than that which was
obtained with the ADC interface on which RB collaborated with
Brookhaven. The latter unit was built with computer-type
construction: commercial logic cards and wire-wrapped back
panel. Debugging of that unit was exceedingly laborious because
of the lack of modularity in its components.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>The computer-independent bus system has not been expensive
in manpower. It has required about 9 man-months in
design and debugging and somewhat less time in construction.
The registers cost about $300, as mentioned, and the controllers
$1500 to $2000 depending on the need for cable drivers.</p>

<h3>G. A PROCESS-CONTROL SYSTEM: THE BROOKHAVEN MULTIPLE SPECTROMETER
CONTROL SYSTEM (MSCS)</h3>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

<p>In 1965, a system based on an SDS 920 computer was put into
operation at the Brookhaven National Laboratory to control
data-acquisition processes involving eight neutron spectrometers
and one x-ray spectrometer. The neutron spectrometers
are located on the floor surrounding the High Flux
Beam Reactor (HFBR); the x-ray spectrometer was placed in the
same building in order to facilitate linking it to the computer.
The system can control the execution of experiments on all
nine sets of apparatus simultaneously, yet each experimenter
feels that he is working essentially independently of all other
users. The system controls all angular rotations of crystals
and counters, all detector counting, the data displays, the
input and output operations, and automatic error responses.</p>

<p>It can also perform most of the calculations necessary
for real-time guidance of the course of the experiments. For
example, the experimenter can mount a crystal on a goniometer
at approximately the correct angular orientation, then he can
specify to the computer where several peaks should be found,
whereupon the computer will direct the execution of a trial
experiment to find where the peaks do, in fact, occur, executing
least-squares calculations in the process, after which
the error in crystal orientation is known and the angular
scales are automatically corrected. In another example, the
computer is given as input information the crystal constants
(unit cell) and the zone orientation of the crystal on the
goniometer and is asked to produce a scanning of a given part
of reciprocal space. The computer then calculates where to
look, turns to a correct angle to check the intensity of a
central peak, and performs the other necessary steps, making
many decisions as it controls the execution of the entire
experiment.</p>

<h4>2. Description of System</h4>

<p>When it was first assembled, the system included only two
teletypes, both located near the computer. Early in 1969, a
communications network was added to permit the installation
of a local, assigned typewriter at each of the nine spectrometer
stations, as well as three assignable remote teletypes
located in the Chemistry and Physics buildings. This
network incorporates a Varian 620i computer. It permits any
ordinary operation to be carried out from any of the 12 remote
stations, except program loading, which still must be
done via the high-speed paper-tape reader at the computer.</p>

<p>The major parts of the system (Figure 10) are the SDS
920 computer with a 16k, 24-bit memory, a bulk storage memory
section comprising two magnetic tapes units and one 32,010-word
drum, the communication network, and the nine local control
stations (SCS) at the spectrometers. Each SCS (Figure
11) contains the stepping motors required for computer control
of angular rotations of crystals and counters, together with
shaft rotation encoders (optional, incremental type) to feed
information back to the computer. Each SCS also includes
manual controls, the electronic counters associated with the
radiation detectors, counter displays, a decoding and control
section, and other related equipment.</p>


<h4>3. Lessons from Operating Experience</h4>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a. The system now does "all things imagined to be
necessary."</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;b. The computer has proved to be remarkably reliable,
with a record of about 40,000 hours of use without a breakdown.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;c. A reasonable amount of preventive maintenance is done,
mostly during the one week of four that the reactor is shut
down.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;d. One person serves as operator and programmer (for
simple jobs). He also transports magnetic tapes to the computing
center for off-line data processing and performs smaller
tasks. The average user does not need to do any programming.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;e. Fortunately, the people who have written most of the
programs have remained in attendance and have updated the
programs frequently. Machine-language programming has not
proved to be a bad chore because the system is a fixed-hardware
setup.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;f. Modes of data collection can easily be changed.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;g. The overall performance is excellent. The only problem
is an occasional wiping out of a program due to the fact
that there is no hardware memory-protection feature in the
computer. These accidents are estimated to cost at most a
loss of a few percent of the running time.</p>

<h3>H. RELATIONSHIP TO A REMOTE COMPUTING CENTER</h3>
<h4>1. The Small Computer with a Fast Data Link to a Remote General Computing Facility</h4>

<p>Although the use of a small data-acquisition and experiment-control
computer on-line to a remote computing center machine
is not uncommon in high-energy particle physics applications,
we know of few such systems presently operating in low-energy
nuclear physics.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this discussion, we define "general
computing facility" to be a relatively large-scale centralized
installation charged with the responsibility of servicing a
wide range of computing needs. The typical university computing
center is our model for such a facility.</p>

<p>In light of the fact that only a few years back the
remote computer on-line to a general computing facility was
considered to be the wave of the future, with plans for such
systems under vigorous discussion at many low-energy physics
installations, it is at first sight surprising that there is
so little progress to report at this time. The Van de Graaff
accelerator laboratory at the State University of New York at
Stony Brook was one such facility planning to couple a PDP-9
on hand to an IBM System 360/67 available at the university
computing center. It is instructive to examine what happened
there. In 1967, with the completion of the new accelerator
scheduled within a year, it was decided that the best way to
acquire the desired power and flexibility in computing support
was through a coupled system of the kind under discussion.
Plans were formulated for a high-speed transmission line to
a control unit on a selector channel at the computer center.
Since true time-sharing of the System 360/67 was not in the
offing, a 128k-byte partition of high-speed core storage was
to be permanently dedicated to the needs of experimental physics
(including the particle-physics group), and a high-speed
program-swapping drum and at least one tape drive were to be
assigned to the physics users as well.</p>

<p>What actually happened was that as funds became available
to the low-energy physics group to implement its share of the
remote link to the computer center, sentiment shifted to the
point of view that the funds could more usefully be invested
in a second PDP-9 installed at the accelerator, and the second
small-to-intermediate class computer was in fact purchased.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
The two PDP-9's are coupled only by a switchable tape drive,
with no plans at present for direct channel-to-channel communication.
Plans for a remote link to the computing center
have been completely dropped; any further funds for computing
will be invested in larger high-speed core stores for the
PDP-9's, at least in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Conversations with the principals involved in the operation
of the Stony Brook low-energy physics facility fail to
yield a clear and uniform explanation of the change in computing
outlook. One cannot escape the impression that the
group was not wildly enthusiastic about the proposed remote
linkup in the first place, and that the evident immediate
benefits to the group of a second PDP-9 on hand for program
debugging and experiment setup while the second machine was
running an experiment were irresistible when compared to the
future promise of a remote link to the IBM 360/67. The physicists
were not anxious to undertake what was expected to be
a substantial systems program development task for the coupled
system, being unconvinced that the result would be worth the
effort. While they still wish to increase the computing power
available to them on-site, they have elected to achieve that
end by expanding high-speed core storage on their machines,
at least until true time-sharing becomes available at the
central computing facility.</p>

<p>The coupled system at the University of Manitoba cyclotron
is representative of what was intended at Stony Brook. At that
installation, the PDP-9 is linked to the computing center's IBM
360/65 by a control unit commercially available from DEC for
about $15,000. The unit connects the PDP-9 (or its successor,
the PDP-15) directly to a System 360 selector channel, without
requiring an additional control unit. The maximum data-transfer
rate at Manitoba over a 2000-foot twisted pair cable is
50k bytes/sec. A relatively unsophisticated set of system
programs has been written to control communication and transfer
of data between the two computers.</p>

<p>The only experiment to which the coupled system (as distinct
from the stand-alone use of the PDP-9) has been applied
is a p-p bremsstrahlung measurement, where the data are developed
in wire spark chambers and plastic scintillation
counters. Information from the wire chambers defines proton
trajectories, and pulse heights from the counters determine
their energies. The PDP-9 first tries to reconstruct a vertex
from the proton trajectories. If a point of origin can be
determined for the protons to the required accuracy, the
relevant coordinates for the proton trajectories and the pulse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
heights are sent to the IBM 360/65 for full kinematic and
statistical analysis of the individual event; otherwise, the
event is rejected. The large computer also prepares displays
and plots of physical interest that are returned to the PDP-9
for display on the local CRT or output on the local <i>x-y</i> plotter.</p>

<p>The remote computer operates in a multiprogramming rather
than in a time-shared environment, with an assigned partition
of 65k bytes. Because of the well-designed program overlay
feature of the 360/65 operating system, the Manitoba group
does not find itself restricted by this relatively small partition.
Because of other demands on the computing center,
however, they are restricted in the use of this partition to
16 hours/day and 5 days/week. The operation of the coupled
system is controlled almost entirely from the PDP-9 teletype,
with 360/65 operator intervention required only for initial
loading of the partition, off-line printout, and, of course,
mounting magnetic tapes at the computing center.</p>

<p>Users of the Manitoba system are pleased with the cooperation
and service they have received from the computing
center thus far, and they are anticipating no difficulties
developing as their demands on the central computing facility
increase. But while use of the coupled system for experiments
other than that described is clearly possible and desirable,
no information was available on plans for the future.</p>

<p>The Brookhaven on-line remote network (Brooknet), where
a pair of CDC 6600 machines sharing a common one million <i>word</i>
extended core storage unit may be interfaced over a high-speed
channel to as many as 64 remote data-acquisition computers,
can be considered an extreme example of a coupled system.
Although the software for Brooknet is reported to be complete
and debugged, the system has not yet begun routine operation,
and the first remote computer intended for low-energy physics
application (a PDP-15) has not yet been delivered. (The only
Brooknet user at present is the Chemistry Department, which
has a remote batch terminal: teletype, card reader, and
printer.)</p>

<h4>2. Reasons for Lack of Popularity</h4>

<p>Why has linking data-acquisition computers directly to computing
centers not proved as popular as the obvious advantage
of having access to an extremely powerful computer would lead
one to expect? There are a number of contributing factors:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Since the remote computer can be used only if it is
in operating condition and if the necessary personnel are
present, the physicist stands to lose some of his independence
and flexibility of operation (often not four-shift operation).</p>

<p>2. Most remote computers operate on a multiprogramming
basis, hence prompt interrupts are not available. The waiting
time for attention might typically be several tenths of a
second, therefore the computer in the physics laboratory should
be fairly powerful in order to handle the preliminary processing
and buffering. With such a computer at work the
necessity for fairly rapid access to the large remote machine
may entirely disappear, or else the experimenter may be able
to store partly processed data on magnetic tape for subsequent
further reduction off-line at the computing center.</p>

<p>3. The total amount of time available to one user of a
shared-time system per day is always limited. The amount of
access time guaranteed by the computing center may not be
sufficient.</p>

<p>4. In some cases there is a question of charges, and
the total expense of involvement with the computing center
may be comparable over a period of several years with the
extra cost of buying a sufficiently large local computer for
the laboratory to be able to handle all the essential on-line
calculations. Even though the calculations may take longer
in terms of machine time, they may not require as much lapsed
real time if there are stringent limitations on computer center
access time.</p>

A REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF EXPENDITURES</h2>


<p>In this chapter we present a review and an analysis of total
expenditures for on-line computing in a large number of
laboratories supported by the Atomic Energy Commission and
the National Science Foundation through 1968. (Appendix B
gives the background for this economic survey.)</p>


<h3>A. THE NATURE OF THE DATA</h3>

<p>Laboratory directors were requested to supply a separate
report covering each data-acquisition system currently in use
or under construction and, in addition, to supply an estimate
of anticipated future requirements for the period 1970-1974.
The high-energy field was excluded. Information was also
requested on process-control applications, e.g., systems to
control accelerator operation or to monitor progress and to
execute control functions during the course of an experiment.
In every case details were to be supplied regarding the nature
and capability of the system and its cost in dollars and manpower
during the design, construction, and operation phases.</p>

<p>In all, 46 different systems were reported by 22 different
institutions (listed in Appendix B).  Berkeley,
Brookhaven, and Oak Ridge together reported 21. The various
systems range in total cost (including manpower) from about
$40,000 to about $1,000,000. Most are in operation, but a
few are under construction, and a few others are in the advanced
proposal or design stage. Plans for 16 substantial
expansions and proposed expansions of existing systems were
also reported. There was a wide range of thoroughness of
compliance with the request; for example, cost estimates
ranged from the most meticulous analyses down to one case
where no cost information whatever was supplied. In assessing
the reliability and completeness of the data the
reviewer concluded that in general the costs of manufactured
hardware items such as central processors (CPU's), line
printers, card readers, rotating memory devices, etc. should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
be regarded as reasonably accurate, while estimates of the
amount of manpower used, and its cost, seemed much less reliable;
in fact, the manpower item was frequently not covered,
especially in connection with the preparation of systems
software. Whenever a report was more or less complete, and
there seemed to be a reasonable good basis for doing so, the
reviewer estimated appropriate values for missing items by
making use of figures given in more complete reports on similar
systems constructed or operated under similar circumstances.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus-59.png" width="700" height="133" alt="" />
<p class="center"><b>FIGURE 12</b>&emsp;Breakdown of system for analysis.</p>
</div>

<p>With regard to labor costs, government laboratory people
seem to be in a much better position to supply figures than
are university people. The reviewer got the impression that
the university respondents have, on the average, a much less
clear idea of the dollar value of people's time and a much
less clear idea of how to estimate realistically the man-hours
consumed by various projects.</p>


<h3>B. BREAKDOWN OF DATA FOR ANALYSIS</h3>

<p>Because of the nature of the data the reviewer separated each
system into three parts for the purpose of analysis: (1) the
data-acquisition central processor (CPU); (2) the standard
computer input-output (I/O) devices such as magnetic tapes,
disks, card readers, printers; (3) the complete data-acquisition
subsystem (DAS). (<a href="#Page_59">See Figure 12.</a>) This breakdown has
the advantage that the costs of the first two parts of the
system are usually fairly accurately known. The cost of the
DAS includes the price of all manufactured units closely
involved in its assembly, including scalers, ADC's, pulse-height
analyzers, and the like (but not detection equipment),
together with the expenses associated with all special construction,
including engineering, fabrication, and parts.
All engineering and fabrication costs associated with the
entire system can logically be charged against the DAS,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
because the CPU and I/O parts, being assembled from standard
manufactured items, generally are installed by the manufacturer
without much effort or expense on the part of the laboratory
personnel. Questions occasionally arose in connection with
the assignment of the cost of interfacing the DAS to the CPU.
Such costs were assigned to the DAS when the units involved
were of a custom-built nature and to the CPU when they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
manufacturer's items incorporated in the computer frame.
The very wide range of types of data-acquisition equipment in
use necessarily contributes to the spread in DAS costs. Although
a number of items of uncertain costs are lumped together
in this definition of the DAS, the procedure adopted is believed
to have led to a valuable overall picture of the pattern
of expenditures.</p>

<p>A fourth item of importance in the analysis is the cost
of system software programming. This is almost entirely a
manpower item, assuming that program testing and debugging
can be carried out without charge for the computer time involved.
Here there is considerable uncertainty in the estimates,
especially with respect to university installations
as well as systems which have been in operation for a long
time, e.g., the large system at Argonne.</p>

<p>The total cost of a system is taken to be the sum of the
four items listed above, namely, the CPU, the standard I/O
system, the DAS, and the system software expenditures. In all
likelihood the total costs tend to be too small rather than
too large because of incomplete assignments of charges of
various sorts, especially manpower. In many cases the totals
seem reliable to 10 or 20 percent, while in a few others an
error of 30 or even 40 percent would not be surprising.</p>


<h3>C. TYPES OF COMPUTERS</h3>

<p>Table 8 gives a listing of the 27 different types of computers
incorporated in the systems reported, together with the number
of units of each type mentioned. Of the 27 types, 24 are
machines designed with this general sort of application in
mind; the exceptional three are the CDC 160A, the CDC 3100,
and the IBM 7094. Evidently, the PDP machines are the most
popular (24 units), followed by SDS types (8 units), and
IBM types (5 units).</p>


<h3>D. SOME TOTAL COSTS</h3>

<p>Of the 46 system reports, 35 were sufficiently complete to
be useful in a detailed analysis. A histogram showing the
distribution of these in total cost is given in Figure 13.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
One immediately sees that few systems cost less than $100,000;
in fact only four were reported in this range. However, it
must be pointed out that information was solicited regarding
only those systems which had cost approximately $50,000 or
more. The most common range is $100,000 to $200,000, with 12
examples. The total cost of the system at the Yale Van de
Graaff laboratory was not known when the histogram was prepared,
but the hardware is reported to cost about $750,000 to
duplicate and about $655,000 to copy, so if allowance is made
for the cost of developing the software and for other manpower
uses the cost would rise substantially. (This system is not
one of the 35. The conditions under which the Yale-IBM development
are being carried out are so special that manpower costs
cannot be assigned on the basis used in other cases.
<a href="#Page_33">Chapter 2, Section E.</a>)</p>

</div>


<p>A breakdown of total costs for the 35 systems is given
in Table 9, showing separately the total amounts involved in
each of the four categories defined above. Evidently, about
60 percent of the cost goes for standard computer hardware,
while about 40 percent goes for special hardware and software
required for data acquisition. Table 10 shows separately the
hardware and labor costs in the DAS item. Evidently, hardware
is twice as expensive as labor in this case, on the average.</p>

<h3>E. BREAKDOWN OF COSTS BY SYSTEMS</h3>

<p>In Figure 14 the cost of the standard I/O equipment is shown
plotted against the cost of the CPU for 36 different systems.
The high point labeled "T" represents a system having many
high-speed magnetic tape drives. The low point labeled "R"
represents the Rochester system, which must be considered
unbalanced, because its only "standard" I/O equipment is four
Dectapes, which should, perhaps, have been defined as CPU
items, since they cannot be used for communication with most
computing centers. If a line printer and two IBM-compatible
tape units were added, the Rochester point would have to be
raised at least as high as the position R'. The straight line
shown in Figure 14 was drawn with a slope of one half. It may
perhaps be taken to represent a rough statistical reflection of
the collective experience accumulated over the past six years
or so regarding the relative costs of I/O and CPU equipment.
In Figure 15 DAS costs are plotted against CPU costs for the
same 36 systems. Here the spread of the points is worse than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
in the previous case, as expected for the reasons mentioned
earlier. The exceptionally high point labeled "PHA" represents
a system with three large pulse-height analyzers, two of them
20,000-channel units, in the DAS. The straight line shown has
the equation&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>y</i> = 8.0 + 0.7<i>x</i></b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The overall DAS cost is 77 percent of the total CPU cost.</p>

<h3>F. ROTATING MEMORY DEVICES</h3>

<p>One magnetic drum unit and 11 disks were reported to be in
service (in eight different laboratories). Plans were reported
for the installation of six more disk units and one drum (in
five different laboratories). Recognition of the importance
of rotating memory devices in display applications is evident
in the reports.</p>

<h3>G. SYSTEMS ON-LINE WITH COMPUTING CENTERS</h3>

<p>Two systems were clearly stated to be in successful on-line
operation with external computing centers. (At least one more
example, at the University of Manitoba, is known: there a
PDP-9 system is linked to an IBM 360/65.)</p>

<p>There are plans in various stages of development to connect
nine different data-acquisition systems on-line with
computing center machines, in most cases to operate on a delayed-access
basis.</p>


<h3>H. ANTICIPATED FUTURE EXPENDITURES</h3>

<p>In cases where updating or enlarging of existing systems was
said to be in progress, the costs reported were usually assigned
by the reviewer to the present system, especially when
money for the expansion seemed already available or very likely
to become available. In many cases plans were in a less advanced
state, but a fairly definite idea of the amount of
money to be requested for expansion or for completely new
systems was expressed. Table 11 summarizes these anticipated
costs.</p>

<h3>I. INVESTMENT IN ACCELERATORS, COMPUTER SYSTEMS, AND
LABORATORY BUDGETS</h3>

<p>C. V. Smith and George Rogosa have kindly made available approximate
AEC budget figures for nine typical university
laboratories chosen from those which had returned information
in response to Dr. McDaniels' request. (The laboratories are
Colorado, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Texas, Wisconsin,
Washington, Yale Linac, and Yale Van de Graaff.) After adding
similar information for Rochester, it was possible to get a
rough idea of the relative capital investments in accelerators
and in computer systems and to compare those figures with the
annual operating budgets (for 1969).</p>

<table summary="">
  <tbody><tr>
      <td class="ftop ul">total annual budget</td>
      <td rowspan="2" class="fpad center">=&nbsp;0.33</td>
      <td rowspan="2" >&nbsp;</td>
      <td rowspan="2" >&nbsp;</td>
  </tr><tr>
      <td class="fbot">cost of bare accelerator</td>
  </tr><tr>
      <td class="ftop ul">total computer cost</td>
      <td rowspan="2" class="fpad center">=&nbsp;0.23</td>
      <td rowspan="2" class="fpad">&rArr;</td>
      <td rowspan="2" class="fpad" >0.22 ± 0.06 by averaging<br />
      separate ratios<br />for each system</td>
  </tr><tr>
      <td class="fbot">cost of bare accelerator</td>
  </tr><tr>
      <td class="ftop ul">total computer cost</td>
      <td rowspan="2" class="fpad center">=&nbsp;0.70</td>
      <td rowspan="2" >&nbsp;</td>
      <td rowspan="2" >&nbsp;</td>
  </tr><tr>
      <td class="fbot">total annual budget</td>  </tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>If the ratio of the total computer cost to the annual budget
is calculated for each of the ten cases, and then the results
are averaged, one gets 0.6 ± 0.3. If one quite unusual set of
data (from a laboratory with a small AEC budget) is eliminated
the last result becomes 0.56 ± 0.21, while the earlier results
remain essentially unaltered. For the same nine examples we
find that the average of the ratios of total computer system
costs to bare accelerator costs is 0.22 ± 0.062, thus this
ratio is significantly more consistent. It is emphasized that
the results given in this paragraph refer only to experience
at universities.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_4" id="Chapter_4">Chapter 4</a><br />
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON SYSTEM PLANNING</h2>

<h3>A. THE NEED FOR ON-LINE COMPUTER SYSTEMS</h3>


<p>The ultimate justification for assembling and using on-line
data-acquisition systems must be made in terms of research
output. The same considerations underlying judgments on the
support of experimental research in other ways must therefore
apply to computer systems. Some reasons often given for the
use of on-line computer systems are these:</p>

<p>1. Modern experiments produce vast quantities of data
which can be handled efficiently only by automatic calculating
machinery. The experimenter gains greatly in effectiveness
when the data are immediately converted into machine language,
reduced by the computer, and presented to the experimenter in
a convenient form.</p>

<p class="com"><i>Comment</i>: Undoubtedly true. Fortunately a small
system can satisfy this requirement in many cases.</p>

<p>2. Some experiments "cannot" be done by other means.</p>

<p class="com"><i>Comment</i>: More likely true in practice than in
principle.</p>

<p>3. Investment in a computer system is sometimes sound
because it leads to a net reduction in the overall cost of
performing experiments, either by eliminating some of the
labor cost, by reducing the consumption of accelerator time,
or in some other way.</p>

<p class="com"><i>Comment</i>: True in many cases. Making estimates of
projected savings is easier in <i>ad hoc</i> cases than in general.</p>

<p>4. Having facilities immediately accessible for calculating
nuclear-reaction kinematics, magnetic analyzer field
strengths, and other phenomena during the course of experiments
saves time and promotes efficiency.</p>

<p class="com"><i>Comment</i>: True, however, much of this work can be
done ahead of time, and much of it requires only a relatively
short, simple calculation which can be executed on a medium-sized
computer, sometimes on a small one.</p>

<p>5. Given a sufficiently large computer system in the
laboratory, its use for complicated data reduction and for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
theoretical calculations may produce an important saving of
funds which might otherwise have been spent at the computing
center.</p>

<p class="com"><i>Comment</i>: This point may sometimes be valid, depending
on a number of conditions, but the installation of a large
computer as part of the data-acquisition system essentially on
the basis of this argument is questionable, in view of the
excellent facilities offered by modern computing centers.</p>

<p>6. Some expense for the <i>development</i> of computer systems
and computer systems methods is justifiable as an investment
in methodology.</p>

<p class="com"><i>Comment</i>: True, although there is some question about
the choice of places where such work should be done and about
the correct source of funds to support it.</p>

<h3>B. WHERE SHOULD LARGE-SCALE CALCULATIONS BE DONE?</h3>

<p>At the very outset of planning one should examine very closely
the question of the large-scale calculating required in the
overall execution of the research program of the laboratory;
then, if, as usual, it turns out that a substantial amount of
complex calculating is anticipated, one should consider carefully
the feasibility of planning to do that part of the work
at the most readily accessible computer center in the vicinity,
so as to be able to concentrate one's own energies and resources,
especially capital investment, on the data-acquisition
system. The use of a modern computer center offers enormous
advantages, and most computing centers would welcome support.
If this course of action is chosen, provisions must be planned
from the start for computer-language communication between the
computer center and the nuclear research laboratory via a
medium such as magnetic tape. (Direct wire transmission will
often not prove feasible.)</p>

<p>Some key questions are:</p>

<p>1. How much large-scale computing is anticipated?</p>

<p>2. How much waiting time for results is tolerable?</p>

<p>3. Can the local computing center handle the needs, and
at what cost?</p>

<p>4. If the local computing center can handle all the
needs, but only after acquiring certain additional support
for equipment or manpower, might not the better course of
action be to provide that support rather than to set up separate
facilities?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Can setting up a large system truly be justified?
Have all the extra costs and complexities of the large system
been taken into account, including those associated with input
and output devices, operation, maintenance, programming, management,
and space?</p>


<h3>C. EXERCISING ECONOMIC JUDGMENT IN PLANNING</h3>

<p>Since the ultimate criterion is research output, the role
assigned to a computer system must depend on the nature of
the work being planned. In some cases where a very specific
use is intended, for example, in the case of a process-control
application such as the Argonne plate scanner or an accelerator
controller, the conditions are simple enough to make economic
judgment relatively easy to apply. In the case encountered
in setting up an accelerator laboratory where a wide variety
of experiments is to be performed, conditions are much more
complex. It is now widely accepted that any such laboratory
should have a computer system, but what is not so clear is
how extensive and expensive it should be. In other words,
points 1-4 in B are accepted, and point 5 is conceded possibly
to be applicable.</p>

<p>If sufficient funds are available, one sensible way to
proceed is to use the accumulated collective experience
outlined above. For example, one can say that experience has
shown that the total investment in the computer system will
be in reasonable balance with the capital investment in the
bare accelerator if the ratio of costs is about one to five.
Departures from the rule may then be made to adjust to special
circumstances. Following this procedure means extrapolating
from past experience, which may not prove a good guide, but
this approach is similar to that often used in other matters
bearing on the support of research. Probability is involved.
It should be noted that the actual expenditures for on-line
equipment for nuclear research have far exceeded those projected
at the "Grossinger Conference on the Utilization of
Multiparameter Analyzers in Nuclear Physics" in 1962.</p>

<p>In times of economic stringency it may be necessary to
take a hard look at points 3-5 in B above before deciding how
large a computer can be justified. A medium-sized computer
is sufficient for most data-acquisition demands but not for
large-scale calculations of a theoretical nature or for an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
occasional complicated piece of data reduction. Often it will
be advisable to plan on carrying out all large calculations
at the computing center, in which case a medium-sized computer
will probably suffice for data acquisition, and a saving of
about half in capital investment and operating expenses can
be achieved.</p>


<h3>D. ON THE UTILITY OF SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED COMPUTERS</h3>

<p>If economic realities and good judgment should dictate the
choice of a smaller system, the laboratory will still be well
off. There is a tendency not to recognize the full capabilities
of modern medium-sized and small computers, which, given
intelligent programming, are very powerful. Although programming
is in general expensive, the return for a modest amount
of it in terms of data-acquisition performance may be very
impressive. For example, the use of tables calculated ahead
of time, stored on magnetic tape at the computing center, and
read into the data-acquisition machine along with its control
program offers a way to bypass the need for various sorts of
calculations which might have been done on-line on a larger
system. Increased efficiency of data acquisition often comes
from the use of such methods, reflected in increased data-handling
rates.</p>


<h3>E. GROWTH CONSIDERATIONS</h3>

<p>The system planner should try to anticipate a possible future
expansion. In the case of a cut-and-dried process-control
application it will often be safe to assume that the system
will not have to grow, but recent history shows that in the
case of general-purpose systems growth is the rule. In fact,
systems have sometimes had to be replaced by entirely new
ones. The system planner must beware of pitfalls. If, in
anticipation of a greater future need, a much larger CPU is
ordered than current use demands, the anticipated need may
not develop. Or, if it happens that the money initially
available for capital investment is so limited that it is all
exhausted in buying the CPU, leaving the system badly short
of conventional I/O equipment, then the system will remain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
painfully unbalanced until substantial additional funds appear.
If those funds do not appear, the capability of the system
will remain far less than the presence of the large CPU would
suggest. (This is what happened at Rochester, where three
years after the system was installed there is still no card
reader, line printer, or conventional magnetic tape drive
system; in fact, there is no computer-language medium for
communication with the University of Rochester Computing
Center.)</p>

Prices are actual costs for equipment supplied by a well-known manufacturer.
This system is powerful enough to satisfy most data-acquisition
needs at a typical low-energy accelerator laboratory.</p>
</div>

<p>The correct strategy to employ in every case should be
consistent with the size of the laboratory and with the capabilities
of its staff. A laboratory with a small engineering
staff and with modest computing needs for the immediate future
should certainly not plan to set up a large system. Instead
it could sensibly begin with a manufacturer-assembled,
trimmed-down version of the Comparison System (Figure 16),
which could be enlarged later as occasion demanded and funds
permitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<h3>F. SHORT SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS REGARDING SYSTEM PLANNING</h3>

<h4>1. Planning and Procuring a Data-Acquisition System Today</h4>

<p>It is no longer necessary to develop one's own system. Times
have changed greatly. Many systems now exist which work well
and are worth copying. Manufacturers and suppliers are prepared
to deliver entire systems assembled and ready to operate,
complete with all the necessary system software and
varying amounts of utility software. Although it may at first
sight seem more economical to assemble a system within the
laboratory, by use of laboratory personnel, in most cases it
is now better to buy the system from a single supplier, completely
installed and operable, saving one's own resources
for matters more directly concerned with research. The costs
in time and effort to develop a new computer system have been
much larger than predicted, in almost every case known to the
authors. Large laboratories having strong engineering staffs
are an exception; outside of industrial plants they are the
places where new system development and assembly makes the
most sense.</p>


<h4>2. Large-Scale Computations and Computing Centers</h4>

<p>In general it is best to plan to do all very large-scale
computing jobs (e.g., shell model and scattering theory
calculations) at a large computing center and to set up in
the laboratory a system which is just large enough to handle
comfortably the data-acquisition jobs. Usually a medium-sized
or small system will suffice. However, in some circumstances
this will not be true.</p>


<h4>3. Remote Large Computing Center On-Line for Data Acquisition</h4>

<p>Direct transmission-line coupling to a large, remote computing
center may prove practical for handling occasional
low-priority bursts of data processing, for example, when
one can be satisfied with guaranteed access within about 100
µsec, say, and a maximum guaranteed total access duration of
no more than a few percent of any day. Such a hookup may also
be valuable for the handling of data input and output in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
remote batch mode of operation, especially if a card reader
(or high-speed paper tape or storage device) and a line printer
are available for this use, in the laboratory. However, there
are few if any examples of successful high-priority prompt-interrupt
operation. One should be extremely skeptical about
the feasibility of relying on this last mode of operation.</p>


<h4>4. Buying versus Renting</h4>

<p>Rental rates have typically been set so that if the anticipated
use period exceeds about three years, economic prudence
suggests purchasing a computer rather than renting, providing
that the necessary funds for capital investment are available.
This can only be true, of course, because the life expectancy
of modern computers is quite long, certainly over five years.
(Also, one hesitates to trade in an old computer for which
an excellent software collection exists!) The argument against
renting standard peripherals is weaker, because they are
electromechanical in nature and therefore have shorter lifetimes;
furthermore, they tend to become outmoded. Renting
can be especially attractive in special circumstances. For
example, a line printer can be rented for the early period
of operation of a system, while extensive program development
work is in progress, and returned later, when the work has
been finished.</p>


<h4>5. New Computer or Current Model?</h4>

<p>Computers are rapidly getting better and cheaper. This
month's machine is much more powerful than last month's, dollar
for dollar. New machines will always be appealing, but the
prospective purchaser must balance their appeal against considerations
of probable delivery date, software availability,
completeness of documentation for both software and hardware,
and in general the manufacturer's support capability. Unfortunately,
these factors usually weigh against a new machine.
As a rule, even a medium-sized system based on a new model
machine will not be in full operation for approximately one
year after delivery, unless both the hardware and the software
have been tried and proven in a previous installation. On
the other hand, in the case of an older model the same factors
may all be favorable, but now the machine probably gives less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
computing per dollar, and the advantage of an early return
on the investment must be weighed carefully against the likelihood
of somewhat earlier obsolescence. At some time during
the life of a computer the manufacturer will very likely cease
to support its software and, usually later, its hardware.</p>


<h4>6. Importance of Software</h4>

<p>Software is all-important, and it is very expensive to develop,
both in time and money; hence a system planner should favor
a central processor for which a large amount of software is
supplied by the manufacturer, especially system software. In
general, when a particular type of machine has already been
delivered to many customers the manufacturer may be relied
upon to supply the essential software needed to run a system:
an assembler, I/O routines for standard devices, and usually
a Fortran compiler. The larger machines will be supplied with
some sort of operating system (monitor), either for batch or
time-shared operation. However, the specialized software
needed for data acquisition will usually not be available unless
it has already been developed by another user. A laboratory
with limited programming resources should therefore
give great weight to obtaining a system already provided with
all essential software and should direct its own programming
efforts to specific data-acquisition problems. Contracting
with an outside company for development of the specialized
software is also possible, although the cost will probably
exceed the salaries of in-house personnel hired to do the
same job, and communication with an outside group is inconvenient.</p>


<h4>7. Utility of Modern Small Computers</h4>

<p>Many small, powerful computers are now on the market. They
are inexpensive but very reliable. For many data-taking
purposes they are quite sufficient, when equipped with appropriate
peripheral devices and an adequate program library.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<h4>8. Utility of Disks and Drums</h4>

<p>Magnetic disk and drum bulk storage devices have also undergone
much development recently. Many good, small versions
are now on the market at rather low prices. The capabilities
of these units must not be overlooked. Attaching a modern
disk unit to a modern, small or medium-sized computer produces
a powerful but economical combination.</p>


<h4>9. Need for Adequate Peripheral Devices</h4>

<p>Unless an appropriate set of standard input-output devices is
provided, the computer will not be used efficiently. A balanced
system with a small computer is likely to prove much
more useful than an unbalanced system with a medium-sized
computer. What is necessary will, of course, depend upon the
uses of the system. For example, if a large amount of program
development is anticipated, the inclusion of a line printer
should certainly be considered, because universal experience
has shown that line printers are immensely valuable during
program development; on the other hand, as a rule they are
not so important in most data-taking operations.</p>


<h4>10. Peripherals (Brand X)</h4>

<p>It is often cheaper initially to use peripheral devices from
a separate manufacturer, with interfacing provided either by
the user or by an outside commercial firm. In this case
difficulties lie in guessing the reliability of the devices
and in achieving software compatibility. Software developed
by a computer manufacturer usually takes advantage of the
peculiarities of his own peripherals. If an outside device
is purchased, the additional cost for programming during the
lifetime of the system should be considered. If competent
engineering effort is available, an interface compatible
with the computer manufacturer's software may be built, with
a possible saving in programming cost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<h4>11. Input-Output Bus Structures</h4>

<p>Standardized input-output bus structures designed to simplify
interfacing to computers have recently been developed. Conspicuous
among them is the CAMAC system already accepted as
standard in many European laboratories. It is now being introduced
into a few American laboratories. Before it can be
accepted as a standard system here, a number of questions
must be answered. For example, what types of external devices
should be interfaced in this way, just ADC's data
registers, counters, and the like, or should line printers,
card readers, and related devices be included? Also, how much
trouble will be encountered with manufacturers' I/O software,
and how much will any necessary rewriting cost? Also will all
computer I/O structures lend themselves to such a system;
specifically, are multiport systems suitable? A national
committee is now studying the CAMAC system to see if it, or
something similar, should be recommended as standard in the
United States. Even after being recommended as standard,
however, any such system cannot be considered successful unless
manufacturers accept it and market a wide variety of compatible
devices. From the manufacturer's point of view the risks here
may seem considerably greater than they were in the case of
the NIM bins. It seems wise to keep watching for the outcome
of this interesting development.</p>

<h4>12. Necessity for Competence in Machine-Language Programming</h4>

<p>Whenever a new type of device is interfaced to a system, some
form of machine-language programming must almost always be
done in order to permit the handling of input-output operations
involving the new device. This is true even in places
such as Yale, where the design emphasizes a maximum use of
Fortran. For this and other reasons, there should be at
least one person on call who is skilled in machine-language
programming and who understands the system.</p>


<h4>13. Manpower for Programming and Maintenance</h4>

<p>The manpower required to maintain the hardware and software
of any system naturally depends on the size of the installation
and the uses to which it is put. Typically, a continuing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
effort must be expended on the improvement of system software
and the writing of new data-acquisition programs. The
existing hardware must be given preventive maintenance and
repairs. Furthermore from time to time a hardware change
must be made. Also, there are administrative matters; even
the smallest system should have within the laboratory at least
one person who will devote a large part of his time to administration,
to the education of users, and to related matters.
In many cases the laboratory has a contract with an outside
firm, often the computer manufacturer, for maintenance of the
computer, and sometimes the rest of the system as well. In
other cases all or part of this work is done by laboratory
personnel. Sometimes several laboratory people are competent
both in machine-language programming and in diagnosing and
repairing hardware ills. Such people are very valuable,
especially if they are also competent to do interfacing of
new devices. In some cases the experimenters do much of their
own data-acquisition programming, in others essentially all
programming is done by professionals. In some university
laboratories much use is made of part-time student programmers,
of whom there is now a considerable supply because of the
growth of education in programming, both in high schools and
at colleges. Students are sometimes remarkably good at this
work and stand to profit later from the experience, but they
are transients, and effort expended in training them is lost
when they leave. Very roughly speaking, a small system will
require a good fraction of the time of a technician-programmer,
a medium system will require at least one full-time
technician-programmer, and a full-time programmer, or some
equivalent combination, assuming an active research program.</p>

BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR CHAPTER 3, A REVIEW
AND ANALYSIS OF EXPENDITURES</h2>


<p>At the November 1962 "Grossinger Conference on the Utilization
of Multiparameter Analyzers in Nuclear Physics" a paper by
W. F. Miller and H. W. Fulbright was presented in which data-analysis
systems then in use in AEC-sponsored laboratories
in the fields of high-and low-energy nuclear physics were
reviewed. By that time many applications of computers had
already been made in the high-energy field, while there were
only a few examples of computer systems to be found in low-energy
laboratories, and those were rather simple. Chapter
3 gives a similar review, but in this case the high-energy
field is excluded; the emphasis is concentrated on the economic
aspects of data-acquisition systems used in low-and medium-energy
physics. In the earlier paper, only AEC-sponsored
laboratories were covered, but in the present case some NSF-supported
laboratories are also included. Chapter 3 is a
condensed version of a paper presented by H. W. Fulbright at
the Skytop "Conference on Computer Systems in Experimental
Nuclear Physics" in March 1969.</p>

<p>The first part of Chapter 3 presents a review and a
simple analysis of the expenditures for on-line computing in
a total of 36 different laboratories supported by the AEC
and NSF. The second part presents a discussion of trends
visible in, or suggested by the analysis, along with some
other remarks about the support of on-line computing facilities
in nuclear-physics research laboratories.</p>

<p>Most of the information was supplied by the AEC. It
was requested by Paul W. McDaniel in letters sent in December
1968. Information was received from about 90 percent of those
from whom it was requested. It was then forwarded to the
author C. V. Smith, arriving in the first two weeks of
February 1969. The NSF found that certain administrative
regulations made the sending out of a questionnaire a complicated
procedure, so a different approach had to be adopted
in their case. Letters requesting the information were sent
by the reviewer himself directly to laboratory directors, the
appropriate names and addresses having been kindly supplied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
by William Rodney of the NSF. Here the response was less
complete. Most of the returns arrived by February 21, 1969.</p>

<p>A large amount of information was available for analysis.
In many cases the laboratory involved had done a thorough job,
and the numbers presented in those cases were especially valuable
in providing a basis for estimating expenses for various
items omitted in less complete reports from other laboratories,
particularly in the case of manpower. In some ways, the
information necessarily remained incomplete because no practical
means of obtaining it occurred to the reviewer; the
organization of the material in the analysis reflects this
fact.</p>
